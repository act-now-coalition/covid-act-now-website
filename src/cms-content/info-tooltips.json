This is measured by the number of positive test results, and does not include individuals who are infected but asymptomatic or never get tested. \n\nWe generally see daily new cases of zero for several consecutive months in countries that have successfully contained COVID and are now operating at normal levels of activity, such as Taiwan, New Zealand, and Australia.",

      "body": "Infection rate, also often referred to as R(t), represents how fast COVID is spreading in a given area right now. Specifically, it estimates the number of people that a single infected person goes on to infect.\n\nFor example, an infection rate of 3 estimates  that, in that location, one infected person will infect three other people, and each of those three people will each go on to infect three more people, bringing the total count of infections to 9 people. Eventually, 9 will become 27 and then 81, and so forth.\n\nDaily new cases may be low, but if infection rate is high, then we know that daily new cases will be high in the near future.\n\nWe generally see infection rates of zero for several consecutive months in countries that have successfully contained COVID and are now operating at normal levels of activity, such as Taiwan, New Zealand, and Australia.",

ICU beds are important because they may be the difference between life and death for people, including both COVID patients, and other patients, such as people who have had a heart attack or suffered an injury.\n\nExperts indicate that during pre-pandemic years, average ICU occupancy in U.S. hospitals ranged from 57% to 82%.",

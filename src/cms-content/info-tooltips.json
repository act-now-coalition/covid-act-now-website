Each metric is graded green, yellow, orange, or red. A region’s overall risk level reflects the highest risk level across all three metrics. For instance, if daily new cases and test positivity are both yellow, but infection growth is orange, then the overall risk level is orange.",

Daily new cases may be low, but if infection rate is high, then we know that daily new cases will be high in the near future.",

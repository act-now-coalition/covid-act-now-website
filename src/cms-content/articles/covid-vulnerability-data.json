  "body": "Contracting COVID is a risk everyone faces — just not in equal measures. If you live in an area that is experiencing a surge, you’re clearly at greater risk. That’s why, back in March 2020, Covid Act Now (CAN) began tracking daily cases by state, county and, more recently, metro area.\n\nOver time, data pointed to another undeniable fact: COVID has exposed and exacerbated inequality across America. Vulnerable communities—particularly [Black, Hispanic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html), and [rural communities](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#pop-factors_newcases)—have borne an unequal brunt of the pandemic’s effects, experiencing higher rates of death and infection, along with worse economic and social outcomes. This isn’t because these groups are inherently more susceptible to COVID, but because the effects of racism and socioeconomic structures have left them more vulnerable to the disease. \n\nOverlooking vulnerable groups has a cascading effect. If the virus is tearing through a specific part of a community, the entire community—no matter what place of privilege one might occupy within it—is at increased risk of COVID.\n\nTo help quantify this problem clearly, CAN partnered with [Surgo Ventures,](https://precisionforcovid.org/) a nonprofit focused on solving health and social problems with precision, to integrate their COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) for every U.S. state and county. This index measures a community's likelihood of suffering more severely from COVID, including higher cases and deaths, and recovering more slowly from the physical and economic harm caused by COVID. As the country navigates the pandemic, **vulnerability data can provide us with a practical and moral compass, guiding us to solutions that include everyone**.\n\n## What is vulnerability?\n\nVulnerability, defined most simply, is an individual or community’s disproportionate exposure to potential suffering. In the context of COVID vulnerability, this exposure isn’t driven by personal choices like dining at a restaurant, but by unavoidable structural and environmental factors. For example, many people do not have the option of working remotely, or may need to live in densely populated spaces that are innately more prone to higher rates of infection. \n\nIt’s important to remember that COVID vulnerability is dynamic, and it doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Some groups have been consistently vulnerable throughout the pandemic—such as elderly or disabled persons who have [experienced more severe health outcomes](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html) than younger or able-bodied individuals. Others may not have been considered vulnerable at the start of the pandemic but became more vulnerable due to policy changes that affect them, or suddenly losing their income. \n\nMoreover, **COVID vulnerability ultimately affects everyone.** For instance, if a county’s ICU capacity is at max, other area hospitals will likely become overwhelmed, making it harder for all infected individuals to access the care they need. From there, disease transmission is likely to increase throughout the rest of the community, posing a greater threat to everyone as the virus continues to spread.\n\n## **What makes a community vulnerable?**\n\nTo better understand vulnerability and capture where the impact of the virus will be most severe, Surgo Ventures created a metric called the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI). It looks at 40 socioeconomic and epidemiological factors, such as a community members’ income, age, and underlying health, as well as their access to transportation and health care.  \n\nSome of these factors may seem intuitive or obvious, such as **population density**: The more dense an area, the easier it is for the virus to spread from person to person, as we saw clearly in New York City at the start of the pandemic. But others may not be as self-explanatory. Why would it matter whether someone lives in a multi-unit apartment building instead of a house? In a crowded apartment building, it’s significantly more difficult to [practice social distancing](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#social-distancing) than it is for a single family living in their own home. The same could be said for a prison, which qualifies as a high-risk environment: Incarcerated people are typically forced to share rooms, bathrooms, and dining facilities, making it much easier for the virus to be transmitted from person to person.\n\nAt first glance, **racial and ethnic minority status** doesn’t seem like something that would make an individual or community more vulnerable to the pandemic—afterall, [race does not constitute any biological predisposition to COVID](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/racism-not-genetics-explains-why-black-americans-are-dying-of-covid-19/). But the trickle-down effects of racism combine to make communities of color more vulnerable.\n\nPeople of color have consistently faced [higher rates of poverty](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) and [lower access to health care](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html), making them more likely to be vulnerable to COVID for reasons ranging from **chronic health conditions** and **food insecurity** to **lack of class mobility** and lack of access to employment that prioritizes COVID safety. \n\nSimilarly, one might not think that the language you speak could impact your likelihood of viral infection, when in reality **language barriers** can restrict a population’s access to vital public health messaging and resources and foster valid distrust in health care systems. For instance, lack of translated websites and translation support services for vaccination sites [pose challenges for non-English speakers](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/22/covid-19-vaccine-registration-non-english-speakers-left-behind/4503655001/) to make appointments.  \n\nSystemic factors are not limited to race, ethnicity, and language. **Rural communities** have also faced increased vulnerability to the pandemic for a variety of reasons including [greater distances from health care facilities](https://www.cdc.gov/ruralhealth/about.html), [increased poverty](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-poverty-well-being/), and [higher rates of chronic conditions](https://hpi.georgetown.edu/rural/). This has resulted in disparities in COVID outcomes such as [higher case rates in rural areas](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#pop-factors_newcases) compared to urban, suburban, and metro areas. \n\n## **How has COVID impacted vulnerable communities?**\n\nSince developing the CCVI, Surgo Ventures has researched [the impact of the pandemic on vulnerable communities](https://surgoventures.org/resource-library/report-vulnerable-communities-and-covid-19), and has discovered the following:\n\n### **Vulnerable populations have been disproportionately more likely to be diagnosed with and die from COVID since the pandemic began.**\n\nFrom the beginning of the pandemic through late January 2021, people in the most vulnerable third of U.S. counties have been 23 percent more likely to be diagnosed with COVID and 32 percent more likely to have died from COVID than people in the least vulnerable third of counties.\n\n### **Health systems in vulnerable communities are struggling more.**\n\nHospitals in high-vulnerability areas consistently report significantly higher occupancy levels than hospitals in low-vulnerability areas, putting them at increased risk of becoming overwhelmed and unable to treat patients. As of January 2021, the proportion of beds occupied by COVID patients is 25 percent higher in high-vulnerability areas than in low-vulnerability areas, down from a peak of 153 percent higher in late summer. Furthermore, high-vulnerability counties had far less access to COVID testing, causing 20.7 million people to live in a [testing desert](https://surgoventures.org/portfolio/action-areas/new-surgo-analysis-identifies-highly-vulnerable-rural-communities-as-covid-19-testing-deserts) (i.e., a county with no test site) as of June 2020. Americans living in the most vulnerable areas have been 29 percent less likely to be tested for COVID since March 2020. As of January 2021, the number of people living in areas without access to test sites has decreased to 7.5 million, which is encouraging but still leaves significant room for improvement.\n\n### **The effects of vulnerability are not limited to health outcomes.**\n\nThe unemployment gap has quadrupled for vulnerable communities, especially for those in urban areas and those with pre-existing socioeconomic vulnerability. While the pandemic has [drastically increased unemployment levels across America](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-recessions-effects-on-food-housing-and), high-vulnerability counties have lost a disproportionate number of jobs and have experienced lasting job loss even as unemployment rates in low-vulnerability counties have decreased. Since March, Americans living in the most vulnerable counties have been 35 percent more likely to be unemployed due to COVID.\n\n### **The vaccine rollout is off to a slower start in vulnerable states, and changing the distribution strategy to vaccinate vulnerable populations would benefit everyone.**\n\nVaccine administration rates in high-vulnerability states are 20 percent lower than that of low-vulnerability states, which can be attributed to the fact that vulnerable states received fewer vaccines per capita from the federal government, and they are slower at administering those vaccines. Without the expanded support, funding, and technical assistance required to accelerate the vaccine rollout, these discrepancies in the national vaccination strategy are likely to exacerbate existing inequities. Redistributing a small amount of doses—only 5.8 percent of all doses, according to Surgo— based on vulnerability would substantially boost vaccination where it’s needed most and benefit the nation as a whole.\n\n## **What can you do about COVID vulnerability?**\n\nSupporting vulnerable communities reduces the collective risk COVID poses to everyone. And everyone can take action: Government officials and nonprofit organizations can leverage the CCVI to better understand where and how to allocate limited resources to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on vulnerable communities. Companies in the private sector can better aid their customers and users by understanding which areas are most vulnerable to the pandemic. Rideshare apps, for example, have been [offering free or discounted rides](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-walgreens-uber-underserved-communities-access/) to health care workers or individuals on their way to receive a vaccine as well to people who need [transportation to job interviews in underemployed cities](https://www.lyft.com/lyftup/jobs-access/get-help). \n\nHere are some ways to take action to address the needs of vulnerable communities:\n\n### **Look at the data.**\n\nCovid Act Now surfaces an overall vulnerability score with a detailed analysis for every state and county in the U.S. Let’s look at Mendocino County and Ventura County in California as an example. Both counties are scored as highly vulnerable, **but for different reasons**.\n\n**Mendocino’s** vulnerability is driven by poorer socioeconomic status, such as lower incomes, high rates of unemployment, and low levels of education. It is also driven by limited access to safe housing and transportation. \n\n**Ventura** is more vulnerable due to population crowding and lack of accessible, well-prepared health services. \n\nWhile Mendicino would need targeted financial resources and increased access to transportation or housing for quarantine, Ventura may require more emergency health care facilities, mobile testing and vaccine centers, and stricter mask enforcement. **The best mitigation approaches take into account these unique vulnerabilities to meet the community’s needs.**\n\n### **What to do with the data.**\n\nAs a resident or advocate for highly vulnerable communities, you can think critically about the unique needs of the community, and identify what factors already make your community vulnerable, what has been exacerbated by the pandemic, and where response is still falling short. \n\n**Health** \n\n* A community with a high proportion of older residents, and/or residents with underlying health conditions, may need financial and food support to encourage staying home and avoiding in-person workplaces. \n* A community with many people in high-risk living and working conditions, such as prisons, nursing homes, and factories, may need stricter employment safety enforcement, rapid and frequent testing, early and easy access to vaccines, and enforcement of limited capacity in these environments. \n* A community with a high population density may require stricter mask ordinances and limited capacity of business, as well as non-essential business closure and increased access to public space. \n\n**Economics** \n\n* A community with high rates of unemployment and poverty, as well as low education and insurance coverage, may need financial relief measures, free testing and vaccines sites, and direct support for those who may not be able to work to support themselves and their families. \n\n**Access**\n\n* A community with limited access to a robust health system may require increased mobile or temporary medical facilities.  \n* A community in which many residents are minorities may require increased support of community leaders and mutual aid organizations that seek to address barriers to care and resources.  \n* A community in which many residents do not speak English may require translated and tailored communication regarding safety, testing, and vaccination. \n\n### **Understand what is, or isn’t, being done in your community to mitigate some of these factors.**\n\nOften the most impactful resources come from the community itself. Identify and amplify the work of neighborhood organizations, such as your local [community foundation](https://www.cof.org/page/community-foundation-locator).\n\n* Are there any grassroots efforts underway to help support vulnerable groups, be it through food banks, donations, volunteering opportunities, or other mutual aid groups?  \n* Can you advocate for eviction moratoriums or for free testing sites in your area? \n* Are there systems set up to ensure that those most vulnerable (incarcerated peoples, nursing home residents) are receiving adequate supplies, care and access to vaccines?\n\n### **Stay up to date on local and state pandemic guidelines.**\n\nIf local policies don’t reflect the reality of the pandemic in your community, consider contacting your [representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative), [senator](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm), and the office of your governor, mayor or local state and county representatives. This could include encouraging mask wearing through guidelines and increased access to masks, additional testing and vaccine sites, funding for low income areas, as well as enforcement of capacity limitations.\n\n## **In conclusion**\n\nMore than anything, the pandemic has reminded us of how interdependent we are — and how necessary it is for *everyone’s* safety to be critical of how we as a country approach care and crisis response. As we enter this phase of vaccine distribution, we can leverage vulnerability data to ensure more efficient, equal access for all communities. Although we can’t undo the harm to marginalized communities we failed to adequately protect, we can change our COVID response moving forward to prevent these disparate outcomes from continuing to build. Furthermore, we can learn from this pandemic to begin addressing health disparities at their root and prevent a future health crisis from harming the most vulnerable among us."

  "body": "**The following resources reflect federal health care standards, workplace safety guidance, and financial resources that are designed to support individuals in response to COVID.** \n\n#### Healthcare Standards\n\n* **Vaccines:** As a result of Operation Warp Speed, COVID vaccines are being provided for free to all healthcare providers. Providers can charge a fee for the cost of administering the vaccine, but private and public health insurance programs will cover 100 percent of the cost. For uninsured individuals, the federal government will be billed for that cost.\n* **Testing:** COVID tests are available for free at health centers and select pharmacies. [Learn more about no-cost testing in your state.](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20tests%20are,available%20in%20your%20area.)\n* **Treatment:** Most major healthcare systems participate in an [HHS program](https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim) that provides claims reimbursement to providers that test patients for COVID and treat those with a COVID diagnosis. In general, existing [federal law](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EMTALA) requires that anyone coming into an emergency department to be stabilized or treated, regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.\n\n#### Guidelines for Workplace Operations\n\n* The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/workplaces-businesses/index.html) and [Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3990.pdf) have each released guidelines for workplaces to operate safely during the pandemic. While the specific guidelines are non-binding, OSHA's General Duty clause requires that employers \"provide their employees with a workplace free from recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\" Employers should also ensure that they are compliant with other federal, state, and local laws and orders.\n\n#### The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)\n\n* PPP loans enable small businesses to keep their workers on payroll. First Draw PPP Loans can be used to fund payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, utilities, worker protection costs related to COVID, certain types of property damage, and certain supplier costs and expenses for operations. The Small Business Administration (SBA) will forgive loans if employers use the funds for eligible expenses and meet all employee retention criteria.

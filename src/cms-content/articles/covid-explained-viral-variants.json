  "body": "Viruses depend on your cells to make more viruses — this is the crux of their existence, and they will use their host to carry out this goal in the most efficient way possible. They carry genetic material (either DNA or RNA) that encodes all of the biological components that make up the virus itself, but they often rely on the machinery of host cells to carry out these instructions. [SARS-CoV-2](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#sars-cov-2) is an example of an RNA virus, a virus whose true objective is to deliver this instructional material to a cell and use that cell and its inner workings to make more copies of the virus. From the virus’s perspective, the clinical disease and characteristics of the pandemic are byproducts of this process.\n\nIn order for a virus to copy itself, it needs to make all of the protein components encoded by its RNA or DNA, and it also needs to copy the DNA or RNA so that newly synthesized viruses have the info they need to continue this process through the next viral generations. But evolution and biological processes are not perfect, and every time this genetic material is copied there's a chance that an error, or mutation, will be made in the sequence. A lot of the time these errors either have no effect, or they result in changes which make the individual virus particles, called virions, defective. Viruses — including SARS-CoV-2 — are mutating all the time, although most of the mutations are either dead ends or do not affect the virus or its properties very much.\n\nSometimes, however, the changes create a virus variation that for some reason persists: The new generation is “better” than the old one. For a virus, “better” means being able to replicate and spread more, which is the “goal” of the virus. When a number of these variations result in the creation of a version of the virus that acts differently in clinically or epidemiologically important ways, it is often singled out for a new name.\n\nThe way variants are named can seem cryptic, but there is a method to the madness. Several systems of nomenclature have been developed over the course of the pandemic, with the World Health Organization (WHO) finally settling on a [standardized way](https://www.who.int/news/item/31-05-2021-who-announces-simple-easy-to-say-labels-for-sars-cov-2-variants-of-interest-and-concern) of talking about variants in public-facing settings. We will examine the most commonly used names by both the scientific and public health communities. Of note, expert bodies generally don't use names of geographic locations in order to avoid stigmatizing the first place to find a new variant. Instead, scientific names for variants are sometimes based on specific amino acids changes or alternately their place in the lineage of their family tree. In June 2021, the [WHO introduced nomenclature](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/) using the Greek alphabet to designate the variants of most concern at a global level, assigned by date of discovery, so for example B.1.1.7 is also known by the WHO label “alpha.”\n\nRemember proteins are made of a chain of amino acids. Each amino acid has a one-letter abbreviation that accompanies its position in the chain. So, for example, in the case of N501Y, the original strain had an N, an asparagine, in position 501 and in this variant it has mutated to a Y, a tyrosine. Each variant can have a number of amino acid changes, so the variant named in Pango lineage B.1.1.7 includes N501Y, the mutation thought to confer an increase in transmission, along with 23 other amino acid changes from its parent lineage. Its lineage name derives from its place in its family tree. In this example B is an original Chinese lineage, B.1 is the lineage that seeded the subsequent Italian outbreak, B.1.1 is a European lineage that derived from that, and B.1.1.7 is the one that became dominant worldwide for a time after being first identified in the U.K. and Ireland. Note Pango lineage is not the only scientific naming convention, but for consistency it will be the one used in this piece.\n\nThere are several ways for more viral evolution to result in more replication: among the most notable of these, better transmission, changes in virus-receptor affinity and antibody escape. We’ll discuss the D614G mutation and B.1.1.7 (or alpha) variant as prototypical examples of evolution in SARS-CoV-2 in the context of these differences.\n\n## **Transmission**\n\nEarly on in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a new variant, known as D614G, became widespread. At first, scientists were not sure whether this variant was actually more transmissible than previous versions or whether it was benefitting from a form of founder effect, where the factors around a particular variant matter more than the variant itself. This is often the case as a new variant emerges — however, time and further study have supported a [true advantage](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2895-3) over its parent lineage. By spring to summer of 2020, [almost all of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences being reported had the D614G variant](https://lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2020/July/0702-newer-variant-covid-dominates-infections.php). The rapid, global spread of D614G not only showed that this variant was more transmissible than its parental strain, but that D614G was able to completely replace its origin strain.\n\nSo how does one little change in the genetic sequence of a virus create a whole new lineage of SARS-CoV-2 capable of virtually replacing its parent strand? D614 is the code for a tiny part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which protrudes from the outer surface of a virus particle. The primary function of the spikes is to attach to, and to somehow penetrate, the outer membrane of host cells. The spike is loaded onto the surface of new virions as they are assembled in an infected cell and the amount of spike that each virion gets can determine how likely it is that the virion will go on to infect a cell in the next generation. Put simply, virions with too little spike on their surface won't be able to stick to a cell or won't be able to get inside as well as virions with more spike proteins available.\n\nThe D614G mutation results in virions that get more spikes on the surface and, possibly, spikes that are more durable and stable, giving the virus particle a higher chance of latching onto a new host cell. The increased spike quantity increases the probability that each individual D614G virion will find a cell, get inside, and replicate. The D614G variant is considered more \"infectious\" than its predecessor because it can get into and replicate within more of our cells. The result of greater spike density and an increased probability of infecting a cell is, quite literally, global dominance of the D614G variant. Consequently, all of the variants mentioned below are further variations of the D614G lineage. And this is how the evolution of new variants typically occurs: small changes on improvements that came before, leading to stepwise changes until a new equilibrium between virus and host is reached.\n\nStepping back, this illustrates one way that a viral variant can come to dominate: It can encode a mutation that makes it more transmissible, or more capable of infecting cells. Other mechanisms, however, can come into play.\n\n## **Affinity**\n\nViruses don't just infect any kind of organism and they don't infect just any kind of cell (they may, for example, focus only on blood cells or eye cells or skin cells). Because different cell types can have very different kinds of internal machinery, viruses have to evolve to hijack only cells with the right machinery to encode their proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 viral spike specifically binds to the host cell types that it has the ability to replicate within, and in fact an increased range of host cell types, extending into the upper airways of human hosts, plays a key role in why this particular virus was able to make a zoonotic leap to pandemic proportions. The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is a protein called ACE2, which is present in many human cells.\n\nAs mentioned above, the amount of spike on a virion is one way to increase the chance that the virion will find an ACE2 cell. Another way to increase the chance is to increase the strength of the hold that the spike has on the ACE2 cell. Think about this as making the virus “more sticky”; the scientific term for this stickiness is increased affinity. Increasing the affinity with which the SARS-CoV-2 spike sticks to the ACE2 receptor is another way to improve the probability that a virion will infect a cell and produce later generations of virus.\n\nThe new viral variant B.1.1.7 (alpha), first discovered in the U.K., has a mutation called N501Y in the receptor binding domain. This mutation creates a stronger chemical bond between the two proteins, enhancing the stickiness. The result is a greater probability of infection.\n\n## **Antibody escape**\n\nA third way for a particular variant of a virus to improve its survival and reproductive success is by avoiding external threats that target the virion. It can [tamp down on internal cellular processes that recognize invaders](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.06.446826v1). It can also avoid the responses of the immune system, like the antibodies secreted by B cells to help eliminate the virus. Antibodies work by recognizing characteristics of the virus — often the spike protein — and that’s how they know to target it. As a result, mutations in the spike protein that change its shape, even slightly, can make antibodies which developed in response to the parent strain less responsive to the new version.\n\nThis type of mutation is of particular concern because it may affect the degree of immunity conferred by previous infection or the efficacy of the vaccine. \n\nOriginally discovered in South Africa, a new lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.351/beta) — one which also carries mutations similar to B.1.1.7/alpha — has been found to carry a K417N mutation. K417 is a prominent part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and because of that, it's a central location of antibody recognition. The B.1.351/beta lineage also carries an E484K mutation in the receptor binding domain that further increases ACE2 binding affinity. Of greater concern, like the K417N, mutations, mutations at E484 are also associated with resistance to some antibodies. This advantageous change has arisen independently across a number of times and locations, further solidifying its role as a mutation of particular importance.\n\nExperimentally generated mutations at E484 reduce the capacity for some antibodies to bind. It's possible that the E484 mutation may be able to avoid certain types of antibodies. However, thus far it’s very unlikely and has yet to be observed that these mutations would nullify the value of vaccination against the primary strain (which are the vaccines we have available). Vaccines may have a decreased response, especially in prevention of symptomatic disease, but hold up quite well against severe disease and death across a wide range of variants.\n\n## **The First True Variant of Concern: B.1.1.7, aka Alpha**\n\nThe variant known as B.1.1.7, estimated to have emerged in September 2020, was first discovered in the U.K. and is now likely present in many other countries. It contains a number of mutations, including the N501Y mutation in the receptor binding domain as mentioned above. It is likely more transmissible due to the evolution of mutations that allow it to bind to its receptor more tightly, and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/scientific-brief-emerging-variants.html) concurs saying, “Preliminary epidemiologic indicators suggest that this variant is associated with increased transmissibility (i.e., more efficient and rapid transmission).” However, there is currently no evidence this variant affects the severity of disease or vaccine efficacy or increases the chances of reinfection.\n\nIn terms of the public health response, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Program, said “While it doesn’t change the rules of the game, it does give the [virus some new energy](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/who-warns-covid-variants-are-highly-problematic-could-stress-hospitals-.html).” Public health agencies will continue to monitor the spread of the variant, with the CDC promising to double sequencing surveillance to 6,500 samples per week and make this data accessible to the [public](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html). \n\nScientists will continue to study the effects of these emerging variants, and vaccine companies will continue to monitor vaccine efficacy against them. Both natural infections and vaccines produce a polyclonal immune response to the spike protein, meaning they target any number of parts of the protein, and it would take a significant accumulation of mutations in particular places to completely escape the protection of the vaccine. \n\nThe good news is that scientists are working to understand how the biology of these new mutants might affect vaccine efficacy, and [have found that](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/mutation-in-sars-cov-2-variant-does-not-affect-vaccine-study-68330) the vaccine is very likely effective against the mutations so far. However, if evidence of vaccine escape starts to occur with specific variants, we have the ability to [quickly modify the vaccines](https://www.axios.com/biontech-vaccine-covid-variant-2388f93a-190a-45f4-ba97-ac50f33fabe6.html) in a way to counter this change. [Dr. Fauci said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/cdc-no-sign-of-homegrown-us-coronavirus-variant-but-scientists-need-to-look-harder/2021/01/11/f70008ba-5422-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html), “I don’t worry about these things, I just take them very seriously.”\n\nAs to what increased transmission means in terms of public health, more cases inevitably lead to [more hospitalizations,](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/who-warns-covid-variants-are-highly-problematic-could-stress-hospitals-.html) and to health systems in many places again becoming stretched thin with exhausted staff and Intensive Care Units close to capacity. This in turn can lead to an increase in the number of deaths not because a variant is causing more severe disease, but because it is causing more cases of disease. However, we already know how to break the chain of transmission. Masks still work. Social distancing still works. Limiting time in crowds or enclosed spaces without adequate ventilation still works. The vaccines still work. And the new variant means implementing these individual and communal efforts are even more important.",

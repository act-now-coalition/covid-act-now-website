  "body": "There are two main categories of coronavirus tests out there: viral tests, which includes both [PCR tests](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#pcr-test) and [antigen tests](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#antigen-test), and [serology tests](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#serology-test). You’ve probably heard about both of them. Broadly, viral tests probe for current infection, and rely on a nasal swab, throat swab, or saliva. Serology tests, also known as antibody tests, test for past infection using a blood draw. Of course, it’s a bit more complicated than that.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved formal versions of either test. But it [has approved](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/vitro-diagnostics-euas) at least 200 tests so far under the “Emergency Use Authorization” authority, meaning the tests can be used now while official approval is still pending.\n\nThese tests received a lot of attention at the beginning of the pandemic, because they were still being developed and there was uncertainty about their accuracy and sensitivity. Before there was a vaccine against COVID, some policy makers considered the expansion of testing as the way out of the pandemic; others argued that testing wasn’t enough. Regardless, testing for COVID has vastly expanded and experts now agree that [testing is essential](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02140-8) for curbing the spread of COVID and getting back to a semblance of normalcy. To understand why there is so much discussion about tests, we need to start by understanding the science behind them.\n\n## An overview of viral tests\n\nViral tests screen for current infection and therefore use methods that test for the presence of the virus. They can largely be broken down into two different types: antigen tests, which directly detect viral particles, and PCR tests, which test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. LAMP tests (shorthand for loop-mediated isothermal amplification) are a third type of test that also look for nucleic acid, but are less common than PCR tests. PCR tests are by far the most widely used and validated method, so we’ll talk about those first.\n\n### PCR tests: Sample Collection\n\nLet’s say you’re showing symptoms of COVID, and you need a test. Or, let’s say you run a labor and delivery unit at a hospital, and you want to screen laboring moms. In these, and many other situations, the test you’ll rely on is the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test. PCR tests are widely used for many kinds of viruses — influenza is the one you are likely already familiar with. The technology for doing this test is well-established.\n\nThe first step in this test involves collecting samples from an individual’s nose or mouth using a cotton swab. A health care worker (or someone else, but generally someone with a lot of training) will carefully extend a long cotton swab into an individual’s nose or throat for a few seconds, allowing it to soak up mucus.\n\nThe most comprehensive way to do this is with what is called an NP (or nasopharyngeal) swab — a very long swab that goes all the way up your nose or way, way down your throat. These swabs are extremely unpleasant, but they are the most likely to catch the virus, since they access the areas where the virus is most likely to live. They are also the most heavily validated; they have the most data suggesting they work.\n\nWhile these NP swabs are regarded as the gold standard, there are other collection methods that have gained popularity and are increasingly validated through experimentation.\n\nLess invasive swabs, including “mid-turbinate” and “anterior nasal,” are much less unpleasant and have the advantage that people can do it themselves. There are fewer studies investigating the accuracy of these swabs than NP swabs, but several [analyses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7494432/) suggest that these swab types [might be just as good](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/06/self-swabbing-tests-for-covid-19-accurate-and-safe.html) as the NP swabs. However, if you are actively sick, an NP swab still likely makes sense, as there is more data showing that this test has low false-negative rates. For surveillance purposes — such as for use in widespread population testing — the less invasive swabs are likely to take over for practical reasons.\n\nSaliva tests are also an option. Saliva tests allow people to collect their own sample at home by spitting in a cup that is then returned to a lab for analysis. Like the self-swabbing methods, saliva tests are advantageous in that you can collect your own sample, so less time, money, and training is necessary for administration of the test. While these tests also have not been investigated at the level of NP swab tests, a [comparative analysis](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2775397?guestAccessKey=8058e841-bc18-4398-a251-54087a84297f&utm_source=silverchair&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=article_alert-jamainternalmedicine&utm_content=olf&utm_term=011521&utm_campaign=article_alert-jamainternalmedicine&utm_content=olf&utm_term=011521) on over 5,000 tests suggests that saliva tests are just as accurate as NP swab tests.\n\n### PCR tests: lab analysis\n\nOnce a sample is produced — be it a mucous-laden swab or saliva cup — it is sent to a lab, where its contents are placed into a PCR machine to do the actual test. The machine looks for the genetic material of the virus. This is hard to do because there is a lot of different genetic material in your nose, like your own genetic material or other stuff you breathe in. Maybe only a little tiny part of it is the coronavirus.\n\nTo find the coronavirus you need to replicate its genetic material so that there is more of it, making it’s easier to detect. With the coronavirus, you cannot do this directly because it is what’s called an “RNA virus.” This means that the genetic material of the virus is RNA, not DNA. Other RNA viruses include the flu, measles, or rabies. RNA is fragile; it’s [single-stranded](https://www.technologynetworks.com/genomics/lists/what-are-the-key-differences-between-dna-and-rna-296719), not double-stranded like DNA. It also has a different backbone structure which makes it degrade more easily; for example, if hair or skin particles flake off onto it, it degrades. So if you try to replicate the RNA genetic material, it will likely break down, and you wouldn’t be able to identify the virus.\n\nTo circumvent this, the first step in the process is to convert the RNA into DNA by introducing a tiny molecular machine that turns the single strand into a double strand. This tiny machine is an enzyme (a biological chemical) called reverse transcriptase. So (very technically) the PCR process that is used for coronavirus is actually an “RT-PCR” (reverse transcriptase PCR), since we start with RNA and then transform it into DNA.\n\nOnce the DNA is produced, the second step in the PCR is to target the newly synthesized SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequence for copying. Right now, your genetic material and the virus’s genetic material (if you’re infected) are all mixed together in one big soup. Let’s think of all of the genetic material present as chapters inside a book, and the coronavirus’s genetic material is the epilogue. Scientists will select a short string of words, let’s say 50 words, that they know is only in the epilogue — a string of genetic material that is only in SARS-CoV-2 and not in human DNA. They create a short DNA sequence (scientists can actually make DNA in a test tube!) that will bind only to the DNA sequence that they’re looking for. These short DNA sequences are called “primers” (see the graphic below). Essentially, primers are a way of pressing control-f, the search and find function on a keyboard, for the coronavirus DNA. If the SARS-CoV-2 sequence is found, it is copied over and over again by a copy machine (an enzyme). Key to the process is that only the targeted viral DNA is copied. [Different tests use different primers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340604/) — basically, they use their search and find function to identify different portions of the epilogue, but they all probe specifically for a portion of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material.\n\n![The coronavirus test works by taking a swab of a person's nose, extracting RNA from virus, and adding an enzyme to convert the RNA to DNA. ](/images_cms/how-does-the-coronavirus-test-work.jpg)\n\n![Fluorescence increases if the test is positive.](/images_cms/how-does-the-coronavirus-test-work1.jpg)\n\nImage source: [How do the tests for coronavirus work? – Compound Interest (compoundchem.com)](https://www.compoundchem.com/2020/03/19/covid-19-testing/)\n\nThat small section of the coronavirus genetic material gets copied over and over again — literally millions of times — which makes the genetic material easier to detect. The graphic above depicts how, when a primer binds to a viral sequence and the sequence is copied, a fluorescent molecule reports that the viral DNA has been found and copied. A computer then detects this fluorescent signal, and a positive result is output. Ultimately if the virus is there, the PCR machine will be able to detect the copies of the virus’s genetic material via this fluorescent messenger and report a positive result. If there is no SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, nothing will be copied, no fluorescent signal is released, and the test result will be negative. \n\nThe lab process for the PCR test takes just a few hours. However, it can often take days to get test results back, mostly due to the logistics of getting samples to a lab and the data analysis and validation. \n\n### PCR tests: accuracy\n\nThese tests are very accurate if the sample is taken correctly and at the right time. In particular, a PCR can generate a false-negative result — telling you that you’re not infected when you really are — if not enough sample is collected, if the sample is collected in the wrong way, or if you test too early (or too late) after infection. Early in infection, the virus is still revving up its replication, meaning it may not have enough copies to be detected yet.  Later, as your body fights the virus, there is less and less of it to detect. And once you’ve recovered, there is no virus. So if you’re tested at a time when there is less of the virus in your system, you are more likely to get a false negative. \n\nTo give you a sense, the graphs below show the accuracy of tests — taken by either nasal or throat swabs — based on days from when symptoms first present. If used right when you first get symptoms, the PCR test works well. As the virus evolves, the probability of detecting the virus decreases, even for those who initially tested positive. With nasal swabs, the accuracy is about 94 percent on “day zero” when symptoms first present. However, by day ten, it’s only 65 percent. The same is true with throat swabs, which are 88 percent accurate on day zero but only 47 percent on day 10.\n\n![Graph depicts how the probability of a positive test decreases as the virus evolves over time.](/images_cms/screenshot-2021-03-15-131238.jpg)\n\nImage source: [Estimating false-negative detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053355v2.full)\n\n### Antigen tests\n\nAntigen tests look for viral proteins rather than the virus’s genetic material. These tests are not as widely used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections because they are not as sensitive as PCR, but some [experts have said that they believe rapid, point-of care antigen tests are vital](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/01/915793729/can-the-u-s-use-its-growing-supply-of-rapid-tests-to-stop-the-virus) for achieving the level of testing we need on asymptomatic and presymptomatic people.\n\nThe FDA has currently granted emergency use authorization to [fifteen antigen tests](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/vitro-diagnostics-euas#individual-antigen). In most cases, a nasal or throat swab is used. Sometimes, in rapid testing, the test can be run while you wait, while other times the swab is sent to a lab for testing. (See our [article about antigen testing](https://covidactnow.org/covid-explained/potential-role-antigen-tests-pandemic) for more about the pros and cons of antigen tests).\n\n### Rapid tests\n\nDue to the slow speed, complications, and expense of PCR tests, many “rapid tests” have gained popularity. There are several different rapid tests granted FDA emergency use authorization. Many rely on antigen testing, while others use a technology similar to PCR called loop-mediated isothermal amplification, or LAMP. Both antigen and LAMP rapid tests have a higher chance of missing an true infection than PCR tests, so if you have symptoms and a rapid test comes back negative-  you should get a PCR test.\n\nThere are currently four at-home rapid tests that have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA. The most recently approved test, [the Cue COVID-19 Test](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-authorization-first-molecular-non-prescription-home-test), is sold over-the-counter and provides results in 20 minutes. It is intended for adults and for children ages two and above with or without symptoms. There are other at-home [rapid tests available that require a prescription](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-authorization-quidel-quickvue-home-covid-19-test) for use. \n\nThere have been many debates on the usefulness of rapid tests. Notably, rapid tests have demonstrated lower accuracy among people who are asymptomatic and might have a very low viral load. PCR tests have better sensitivity in these cases because they replicate and amplify the genetic material of the virus to a detectable level, whereas there is no amplification in antigen tests. LAMP tests involve amplification but are still less sensitive than PCR tests.\n\nDespite the lower sensitivity, many public health experts argue that the speed and low cost of antigen tests would allow us to [administer them at a rate that would help control the pandemic](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00332-4). Likewise they may have the advantage of being most likely to catch people when they are most likely to be infectious- a significant benefit from a public health perspective. \n\n## An overview of serology tests\n\nThe other approach to testing is a serological test, perhaps more commonly known as an antibody test. The point of this test is that it can identify previous infection even after you’ve recovered. If you want to know the answer to the question “What share of people have had the coronavirus and recovered?” you’ll need to test for antibodies (the kind produced by natural infection, not just the vaccine).  \n\nThese are the tests that can tell us if we are moving towards herd immunity or if a significant share of the population is still susceptible. In the case of coronavirus, these tests are valuable in part because a lot of people have the virus without symptoms or with very mild symptoms. These people would probably never reach out to a doctor or hospital to detect infection. Without widespread serology testing, it will be hard to figure out how much the virus has gotten around.\n\nThe disadvantage of antibody tests is that they don’t detect active infection. If you want to identify people early in their illness so you can treat or (more likely) isolate them, this test will not help.\n\nThe reason for this lies in how serology tests work — namely, by testing for “antibodies.”  Antibodies (in general) are proteins your body makes that stick to and kill pathogens (like coronavirus). Generally, about a week after you become infected you begin to produce antibodies. These antibodies are specific to COVID; they are designed to fight this particular virus.\n\nThey come in five classes of “immunoglobulins”: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. The “Ig” stands for immunoglobulin and the last letter is based on their amino acid makeup. All of these antibodies are aimed at killing the virus, although they all have slightly different roles, and their timing differs. For most viruses, IgM is produced first and is a more generalized response, followed by IgG and IgA which are more tailored to fight the particular virus. Less is known about IgE and IgD; IgE is generally involved in allergic reactions rather than pathogen immunity. In the case of coronavirus, [some evidence](https://twitter.com/ragoninstitute/status/1251123075279736845/photo/1) shows that IgM and IgA are produced first, then followed more slowly by IgG.\n\nOver time, as someone recovers from the virus, the antibodies “win” and the virus is defeated.\n\nWhen it is defeated, the virus itself is eliminated from the body. This means you no longer need PCR tests to detect viral genetic material. But, the antibodies stick around (to fight another day!), hanging out in your blood for a certain length of time. This is important (for you) because this is one way your body has immunity (see our [immunity explainer](https://www.covidactnow.org/covid-explained/covid-immunity)). The upshot is that we can figure out if someone was infected by looking for these antibodies in their blood.\n\nThe first step in any serology test is to get a blood sample. The simplest form of these tests are called “lateral flow assays.” These work kind of similarly to a pregnancy test, but with blood, instead of urine. In this kind of test, you take just a finger prick of blood. The blood flows over an absorbent pad, and regions of the pad are designed to catch and hold antibodies that are associated with the coronavirus.\n\nCheck out the picture below! Just like with a pregnancy test there is a “control” line, and then antibody lines. We’ve visualized a test that would show you the presence of both IgM and IgG antibodies. Some detect only one or the other. Since IgM shows up first in the body’s response, this would be the most common place to start.\n\n![Serology blood tests show the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies.](/images_cms/screenshot-2021-03-15-151112.jpg)\n\nImage source: [COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test – BioMedomics Inc.](https://www.biomedomics.com/products/infectious-disease/covid-19-rt/)\n\nAs the blood flows over the pad, any SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present will stick to the pad. Everything else is flushed away. In the end, you can look for the region that captures the antibodies to be colored or not. And there you go. These tests are simple to run and do not require a lab. They take 15 minutes. Theoretically, they can be done at home although no at-home testing has yet been approved. So, that’s good for rapid, on the spot testing (like the population-based tests done in New York). \n\nHowever: these tests are not always so accurate and they are limited in what they can do even if they are accurate. They can detect only the presence of some antibodies, not how many or which type. A positive result doesn’t tell you everything about immunity. These tests have fairly high false-positive rates. Such false-positive rates are a problem for using these tests to (say) let people back to work. In addition, in cases where only a small share of the population is infected, even a small false-positive rate can really mess up your understanding of population-level infection.\n\nThese tests are convenient, but not ideal to really test for immunity. To do better and learn more about possible immunity, we need to test quantitatively for antibodies. We can do this using a technique called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA.\n\nThe ELISA test requires more blood, although not always much more (some labs are doing it with a fingerstick). It also requires a lab for processing and trained scientists to run the samples. But it can tell us a lot more.\n\nIn this test, blood is sent to the lab. There, the blood sample is added onto a tray that contains several tiny wells covered with proteins specific to the virus that these antibodies can stick to. The wells are then washed and the antibodies stay stuck while other stuff is washed away. Following this washing chemical and biological reagents that can uniquely stick to each of the various types of antibodies are added into the wells. The result of this is that each antibody is marked by a different reagent. Different from the quick serology test, an individual ELISA must be performed to detect each one of the five classes of “immunoglobulins” in each sample (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM).\n\nEach well has a chemical reagent added to it. Based on the color change of the dilutions of blood in the wells you can observe the presence of antibodies and the quantity of them. So, for example, say there is a well where the reagent targets IgA. Based on the color change in that well , you can figure out whether the person has IgA antibodies, and how much they have. Like PCR, the in-lab time for this testing is a few hours, although transporting the samples themselves takes time. \n\nThe result of all this is that the ELISA test can determine not just the presence but the quantity of each antibody. This is huge, since it can tell us which antibodies people have and how much, which tells us a lot more about whether they are immune, like how well they responded to a vaccine or how well they are likely to be protected against later exposure to a COVID variant.  \n\nImportantly, serology tests — even ELISA tests — do not necessarily indicate that you are immune from COVID, and [the results should not be interpreted as such](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-disease-2019-testing-basics) because we don’t know how much protection antibodies provide (there are other components to the immune response) and we do not know how long they last."

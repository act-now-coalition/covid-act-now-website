  "body": "When it comes to viral infections — especially respiratory infections — kids tend to be a high risk group. With seasonal flu, for example, the most high-risk groups are the elderly, immunocompromised people, and children. \n\nGiven this general sensitivity of children to respiratory viral infection, it’s not surprising that there was a lot of initial worry about children and COVID. This worry goes beyond the question of whether kids get sick with COVID; it extends to the question of whether kids can also spread COVID. \n\nThis explainer will tackle two questions: How risky is COVID for children? And, how good are they at spreading the virus?\n\nIt’s important to remember that vaccination will play a dynamic role in this epidemiologic picture. Kids ages 12 to 17 were approved for the Pfizer vaccine as of May 2021, with younger children likely to follow later this year. Vaccines will protect kids from infection, including serious cases with long-term consequences, and they will help prevent kids from spreading the virus to their families and close contacts.\n\n(Note: For a complete literature review on COVID and kids, [we also recommend this report](https://dontforgetthebubbles.com/evidence-summary-paediatric-covid-19-literature/)). \n\n## **Kids and disease risk**\n\nThe bottom line is that, on average, kids are both less likely to be infected with COVID and are less likely to be seriously ill. This has become increasingly clear as the pandemic has evolved. \n\nOn the question of infection rates, our best data comes from Europe, where population-based seroprevalence studies have looked for evidence of past infection across age groups. \n\nThere are a few studies like this. [An early one was conducted in Iceland](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100). Researchers there tested about 13,000 random people, including 848 kids. Among the whole population, 0.8 percent of people (so, almost 1 percent) tested positive for COVID. Among children under age 10, though, there were no positive cases. This difference was very unlikely to occur by chance.\n\n[Data from a single town in Italy](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20053157v1) which did very wide-spread screening leads us to the same conclusion: Kids are much less likely than older people to be infected. Larger population screening data from [Spain](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31483-5/fulltext), [Italy](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.20138875v2) and [Switzerland](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-67362031304-0/fulltext) has shown the lowest exposure rates (as measured by antibodies) for children, especially those under age 10. \n\nIn the U.S., the data is patchy given the relatively poor data coverage and limited testing. In places where we have done asymptomatic surveillance testing of both children and adults (such as in [New York City schools](https://testingresults.schools.nyc/)), rates were significantly higher in adults than in children. This suggests the patterns from other countries are likely replicated here.\n\nBeyond infection rates, there is very good evidence that children are much less likely than adults to become seriously ill. \n\nSome of the earliest data on this question came out of a [study in China of 2,143 cases](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2020/03/16/peds.2020-0702.full.pdf) in children ages 0 to 18 (731 lab-confirmed and the rest suspected). In this early sample, 90 percent of infants, 97 percent of confirmed cases, and 94 percent of all cases were asymptomatic, mild or moderate — meaning no significant medical care was necessary. Some children, mostly infants, did get very sick. But this was a small share.\n\nWe can also look to data in the U.S.: A [case series from Chicago](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32479632/) showed that of approximately 6,300 lab-confirmed cases of COVID in Chicago, 64 were in children ages 0 to 17, which accounts for about 1 percent of total cases. Of these 64 cases, 10 resulted in hospitalization, and all 10 of these cases involved children with an underlying health issue. These findings suggest that children represent a small share of infections and serious illness is rare among children, especially among those without underlying health issues.\n\nA similar picture emerges when looking at [CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html) for case data in the United States in 2020. Children 0-4 were estimated to make up 4 percent of overall infections, 4 percent of symptomatic infections, and only 1 percent of hospitalizations. These numbers rise when considering infections in older children and teenagers younger than 17: They were determined to make up around 19 percent of cases, but only 3 percent of hospitalizations. It is important to note that the relative percentage of cases in younger age groups is [expected to increase](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-05-12/04-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf) as older demographics are vaccinated. \n\nThe CDC also [reports death information](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge). Between January 4, 2020 and May 17, 2021, there were 287 deaths attributed to COVID among children under age 17. To put this in context, there were over 40,000 total deaths in this age group from all causes over this period. [Data from Italy shows similar](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763401) patterns: Kids make up a small portion of the total number of serious cases and deaths. \n\nThis doesn’t mean that kids cannot get very sick and there are some reports of kids who present with COVID and an illness called [multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-pmis.pdf). This occurs in a very small number of patients, but most of those patients need hospitalization. Surveillance of these cases in the U.S. is [reported in detail](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2021680); symptoms involve generalized inflammation, high fever, and organ involvement. The constellation of symptoms is similar to what has been seen in Kawaski-syndrome after a viral infection, but with some clinically important differences. The vast majority of children recover and, again, it is very rare. \n\nIn short: it is important not to dismiss the possibility that kids could get very sick, but also to put it in context. The data points to children being very unlikely to get seriously ill with COVID. This is reassuring.\n\n## **Infants and disease risk**\n\nAlthough severe illness is still rare, limited data suggests that infants (children under age 1) are at a [slightly higher risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/caring-for-newborns.html) of severe illness from COVID than older children. The increased risk is likely because their immune systems are immature and their airways are smaller, making breathing issues more likely. Data from China shows that less than 11 percent of infants have severe or critical symptoms, while this rate decreases to 7 percent for children ages 1 to 5 and 4 percent for older children (keep in mind this is just one data set). The CDC states that most infants that test positive are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and recover, but there are reports of severe diseases requiring ventilation. Most data on infants is based on smaller case studies and case reports, so there is still uncertainty in the statistics that we have. \n\n## **Kids and COVID spread**\n\nThe fact that COVID tends to have a mild course in kids is generally accepted at this point. It doesn’t mean an infection cannot become serious, of course, but few do.\n\nAnd, generally, the evidence suggests overall lower infection risk in children. A more complicated question is whether children spread the virus at similar rates to adults — that is, are infected children more or less likely to spread the virus? \n\n(Note that even if children are equally efficient virus spreaders, their lower infection rate will make them lower risk to interact with. Here, we’ll tackle the question of whether they spread the virus conditional on being infected. And remember, as schools open for in-person teaching and kids resume some in-person activities, we’d expect the number of cases to increase just from this change in exposure.)\n\nViral spread is significantly more complicated to study than illness levels. To do a good job, one would need to have careful and complete contact tracing, along with frequent testing. This hasn’t been a feature of the pandemic at all. Most evidence is indirect and, perhaps as a result, the conclusions are not completely clear.\n\nThere are basically three ways researchers have looked at this. The first is indirect: looking at viral load. The most compelling of these studies is one out of Chicago, which studied 145 patients, including 46 children under age 5. This [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952) found that children younger than age 5 carry between 10 and 100 times the amount of genetic material from COVID in their noses than older children and adults. This suggests, not surprisingly, that sick children have viral material. However, the study measured viral nucleic acid rather than infectious virus, so it is actually difficult to know if these children were more infectious. Moreover, it is a big step from this to the question of how much children spread the virus. So, this is a piece of the puzzle, but not the whole thing. \n\nIt is better to look for direct evidence of how much kids spread the virus when they are sick, and this is done in two ways. The most straightforward is to look at infected children and see how much they seem to spread infection, relying on contact tracing. \n\nThe largest and best documented study of contact tracing took place [in South Korea](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-1315_article) and involved tracking about 59,000 in-household and non-household contacts of 5,700 known COVID patients. The researchers found that children ages 0-9 accounted for .5 percent of cases compared to 6 percent of the population, and ages 10-19 accounted for 2.2 percent of cases compared to 7 percent of the population. Children transmit COVID to non-household contacts at rates much smaller than adults in the study (1.1 percent for ages 0-9, 0.9 percent for ages 10-19, and 1.9 percent for adults). Adults also infected household contacts at a higher rate of 11.6 percent as opposed to 5.3 percent in children ages 0-9. (Note that in South Korea, people wear masks and practice social distancing, which contributes to the low non-household contact transmissions. [Wearing a mask is really important!](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#face-mask)) Among young children, transmission even within a household is low: If your child has COVID, there seems to be only about a 5 percent chance that you will get it. Older kids are also less likely to have the virus and less likely to transmit it to non-household contacts.  But [recent data](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-05-12/04-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf) does suggest that kids in middle school  and older, especially the ones attending school full time and in person, play a role in household transmission, even if those odds are lower than they would be for an adult with the same number of contacts.\n\nFinally, a third approach is to look at whether children are commonly “index cases” in households.  That is to say: what share of the time do in-household custers start with a child? [Researchers in the Netherlands](https://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/children-and-covid-19) took this approach by following families — preliminary data has 54 families with 239 people — and looking at infections. They found no cases in which the child was the first one in a family to be infected. Among the 10 COVID patients who were younger than 18 years old, they had 43 close contacts, and none of them became ill. In contrast, 8.3 percent (55 out of 566) of the close contacts of the 221 patients who were age 18 or older became ill.\n\n[A paper from December 2020](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1825/6024998) pulled together all of the published literature on household clusters of SARS-CoV-2. Aggregating across studies, researchers found, first, that asymptomatic cases are much less likely to spread the virus than symptomatic cases (which suggests kids, who are more likely to be asymptomatic, would spread less). They also find in general that only a very small number of household clusters involve a child as the index case (eight of the 213 clusters, or 3.8 percent). \n\nPulling this together, we conclude that while children can spread the virus, younger ones in particular are probably slightly less likely to do so. For older children, while it’s not clearcut, data now indicates older kids do play a bigger role in transmission than younger kids. The lower infection rate in children suggests they are less likely to be the source of the virus. However, we need more data to understand the relative rates of spread to household contacts for child and adult cases, as well as how the changing demographics of infected cases as vaccination increases influence these patterns.\n\n## **The bottom line**\n\nKids are less likely to become seriously ill with COVID, and infection among kids is simply less likely than among adults. It’s not that they are infected and asymptomatic, but rather it seems like they are just not infected very often.\n\nHowever, it’s still unclear how easily infected kids can spread the virus. Younger kids seem to spread the virus relatively infrequently, but after puberty those rates of transmission start to increase. Vaccination will influence this picture until they are available in this entire age group, with kids under 12 making a larger proportion of cases and loci of spread.  But as cases drop in older demographics, this should also help serve to protect children until vaccines are approved in the near future."

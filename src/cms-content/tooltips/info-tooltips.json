This looks at three primary things: weekly new reported cases per 100K, weekly COVID admissions per 100K, and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID patients.\n\nEach metric is graded on a three-color scale. If weekly new reported cases per 100K population is below 200, depending on the levels of the other two indicators, community level can range from Low to Medium to High. If weekly new reported cases per 100K population is at or above 200, depending on the levels of the other two indicators, community level is either Medium or High.\n\n[Read more about the CDC’s framework.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html)\n\nWe updated our COVID scoring in April of 2022 to better reflect the rise in vaccinations and natural immunity.

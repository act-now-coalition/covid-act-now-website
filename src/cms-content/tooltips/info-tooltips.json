This is measured by the number of positive test results, and it does not include individuals who are infected but asymptomatic or never get tested. \n\nWe generally see daily new cases of zero for several consecutive months in countries that have successfully contained COVID and are now operating at normal levels of activity, such as Taiwan, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\n[Learn more about daily new cases](https://covidactnow.org/covid-risk-levels-metrics#daily-new-cases).",

      "body": "Infection rate, also often referred to as R(t), represents how fast COVID is spreading in a given area right now. Specifically, it estimates the number of people that a single infected person goes on to infect.\n\nFor example, an infection rate of 3 estimates  that, in that location, one infected person will infect three other people, and each of those three people will each go on to infect three more people, bringing the total count of infections to 9 people. Eventually, 9 will become 27 and then 81, and so forth.\n\nDaily new cases may be low, but if infection rate is high, then we know that daily new cases will be high in the near future.\n\nWe generally see infection rates of zero for several consecutive months in countries that have successfully contained COVID and are now operating at normal levels of activity, such as Taiwan, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\n[Learn more about infection rate](https://covidactnow.org/covid-risk-levels-metrics#infection-rate).",

Positive test rate can indicate whether a location is getting COVID under control – but only if there is enough testing so that everyone who has COVID is being identified through testing. \n\nA lower positive test rate means either fewer people are infected or more people are being tested. A higher positive test rate means either more people are infected or fewer people are being tested.\n\nWe generally see a positive test rate of less than 1% in countries who have successfully contained COVID and are operating at normal levels of activity, such as Taiwan, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\n[Learn more about positive test rate](https://covidactnow.org/covid-risk-levels-metrics#positive-test-rate).",

ICU beds are important because they may be the difference between life and death for people, including both COVID patients, and other patients, such as those who have had a heart attack.\n\nExperts indicate that during pre-pandemic years, average ICU occupancy in U.S. hospitals ranged from 57% to 82%.\n\n[Learn more about ICU capacity used](https://covidactnow.org/covid-risk-levels-metrics#icu-capacity-used).",

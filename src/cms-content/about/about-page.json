There are 121 million households in the U.S., which each have a handful of machines that run on oil, gas, or antiquated “electric resistance” technology that will need to be replaced at the end of their useful life. \n\nTo power their modern, new, electric replacements — induction cooktop stoves, heat pump space heaters, and heat pump water heaters — we will need upgraded breaker boxes that increase the energy capacity of our homes. This would prepare households for the next step: electric vehicles (EVs), EV chargers, solar roofs and battery storage to power it all.  Every time we miss an opportunity to replace an appliance with a clean, electric alternative, we extend the life of our fossil fuel infrastructure by the useful life of that machine — for at least a decade, and maybe two. Altogether, these electrified and solar households will become an extension of the grid, capable of generating a third of our national energy needs."

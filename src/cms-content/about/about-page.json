America pioneered the collection of energy generation and consumption data. Fresh analysis indicates that electrification and the subsequent decarbonization of our energy grid will slow climate change while saving millions of American households thousands of dollars a year. It will create millions of new, local jobs and restore American economic leadership. 2020 is the decade to decarbonize.\n\n\nWe are very excited about this next venture and the opportunity it provides to apply data- and science-backed decision-making, as well as open-source, accessible tools to the critical initiative of electrification.\n\n\nAs ever, we remain committed to our work on COVID, to maintaining our data, and to helping people navigate the pandemic as it continues to evolve."

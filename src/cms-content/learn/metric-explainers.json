This facilitates a unified approach with common metrics, enabling leaders at all levels to anticipate and adequately respond to their community’s COVID spread, and informing the general public on their community’s risk to COVID.

      "sectionIntro": "### What does the overall risk level for a location mean?\n\nA state or county’s overall risk level takes into account three metrics: daily new cases per 100K (incidence), infection rate (Rt), and test positivity. \n\n* [Daily new cases](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#daily-new-cases), also known as “incidence” in epidemiology, represents the current amount of COVID in a community. \n* [Infection rate](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#infection-rate) is the direction and speed of growth. For instance, daily new cases may be low, but if infection rate is high, then we know that daily new cases will be high in the near future. \n* [Positive test rate](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#positive-test-rate) is a measure of our confidence in the underlying data. For instance, if daily new cases and infection rate are both low, but test positivity is high, then the lack of sufficient testing suggests that we are not capturing the true levels of COVID and both daily new cases and infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported. \n\nEach metric is graded green, yellow, orange, or red. Incidence is the only metric for which there is a dark red, a color we added after the third surge in winter 2020, in order to capture unprecedented case counts. \n\nIf a region’s daily new cases is green, then its overall risk level is green. For instance, if the daily new cases metric is green, but test positivity is yellow, the overall risk level is still green. Otherwise, a region’s overall risk level reflects the highest risk level across all three metrics. For instance, if daily new cases and test positivity are both yellow, but infection growth is orange, then the overall risk level is orange. \n\nThe end goal is for regions to reduce cases to zero, to fully reopen their economies, and for people to resume normal lives, unrestricted by COVID or containment measures.",

If a state or county has a **high** positive test rate, it is a sign of **insufficient** testing in that area. If a state or county has a **low** positive test rate, it is a sign that we are **testing more** than only the sickest people. Testing a larger number of at-risk populations (essential workers, people notified via contact tracing , etc.) is key to catching unknown infections before they can lead to an outbreak.\n\nLet’s look at the pictures below. **There are two positive COVID tests in each of these scenarios,** but the positive test rate differs drastically due to the percentage of the population that is being tested. The closer we get to testing everyone, the less likely we are to miss positive cases.\n\n![Key for positive test rate example](/images_cms/test-positivity-calculate-key.jpg)\n\n![Positive test rate diagram for insufficient testing](/images_cms/test-positivity-calculate-high.jpg)\n\nIn the first scenario, 2 out of 10 people test positive for COVID, so the positive test rate is 20%.

Each ICU bed is staffed by specially-trained personnel and supported with special equipment, such as ventilators. Staffed ICU beds are important because they may be life-saving for some people infected by COVID. In addition, ICU beds are needed to treat not only COVID patients, but also other patients, such as people who have had a heart attack or suffered a life-threatening injury. It is important that hospitals retain enough ICU capacity to take care of both COVID and other patients requiring critical care."

However, there is variability from hospital to hospital, depending on the size of the hospital, whether the hospital is located in a rural or urban area, and other factors. For instance, a small hospital with only four ICU beds running at 75 percent full has only one bed available, whereas a larger hospital with 100 ICU beds running at 75 percent full has twenty five ICU beds available.\n\nSo smaller hospitals with only a few (three to four) staffed ICU beds typically have lower occupancy (30 to 50 percent), and generally have a system for transferring critically ill patients to larger hospitals. Meanwhile, larger hospitals tend to run leaner, with higher ICU usage (60 to 80 percent). \n\nIn general, experts agree that as ICU capacity usage approaches 15 percent, the likelihood of an abrupt outbreak overwhelming hospital systems increases. At such levels of ICU usage, NPIs (Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions), ranging from business closures to stay-at-home orders, may be needed to prevent a hospital system’s ICU from being overwhelmed, which means that it would not be able to serve patients in need of lifesaving care. For instance, in California, the [California Department of Public Health (CDPH)](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.3.20-Stay-at-Home-Order-ICU-Scenario.pdf) calls for stay-at-home orders when this 85 percent threshold is met."

Data may be lost or distorted as it is reported from hospitals to local, state, and federal agencies, such as the HHS. \n\nIn addition, the number of hospitalizations can change suddenly, such as if there is an outbreak of COVID. Such an outbreak may also lead to reporting delays, as hospital staff work to accommodate the influx of patients and prioritize lifesaving care. \n\nFurthermore, hospitals may have “surge capacity,” which refers to a healthcare system's ability to quickly expand beyond its normal capacity in order to meet a “surge, or a sudden and unexpected increase in demand for medical care. In such instances, a hospital may be able to repurpose non ICU spaces, such as hallways, cafeterias, or other wards, to increase their ICU capacity. It may also allow other hospital staff to operate ICU beds under the supervision of trained ICU staff. Thus, although the HHS reports staffed ICU beds on a daily basis, hospital capacity numbers may not always represent the complete picture given the flux in ICU capacity."

One of the best metrics of success for a contact tracing program is the percentage of new cases traced to a known source. However, very few states are reporting this number.\n\nTherefore, as a proxy, **we currently look at the number of contact tracers on staff for each state to estimate the number of contacts that could be traced within 48 hours if the contact tracing program were otherwise working perfectly**. This stems from [expert recommendations](https://covidlocal.org/assets/documents/COVID%20Local%20Metrics%20overview.pdf) that at least 90 percent of contacts for each new case must be traced within 48 hours in order to contain COVID, and expert estimations that tracing each new case within 48 hours requires an average of five contact tracers per new case, as well as fast testing.\n\nWe source our state-level tracers hired data from [Test and Trace](https://testandtrace.com/).

In addition, contact tracing is one our least refined data sets, largely because states themselves are highly variable in their reporting of contact tracing data.\n\nThe boundaries between yellow and orange are tricky.

We will revisit this choice if the CDC puts out more information about general seroprevalence and the infection history of people getting vaccinated. \n2. 2 shots - We require 2 shots to consider someone as having completed vaccination. This stays close to the available science and the advice of experts, including many of our advisers. As more data becomes available we may revisit our choice but we’d rather err on the side of a stricter cutoff.\n3. Permanence of immunity - Until we know more, we assume that someone who has completed vaccination stays immune for the foreseeable future, and we do not try to estimate waning immunity. \n4. Vaccine variations - We treat all vaccine manufacturers equally, e.g. our data combines people who have received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. We will re-evaluate this with any additional data, especially as more types of vaccines become available. \n5.

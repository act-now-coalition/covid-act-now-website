If a state or county has a **high** positive test rate, it is a sign of **insufficient** testing in that area. If a state or county has a **low** positive test rate, it is a sign that we are **testing more** than only the sickest people. Testing a larger number of at-risk populations (essential workers, people notified via contact tracing , etc.) is key to catching unknown infections before they can lead to an outbreak.\n\nLet’s look at the pictures below. **There are two positive COVID tests in each of these scenarios,** but the positive test rate differs drastically due to the percentage of the population that is being tested. The closer we get to testing everyone, the less likely we are to miss positive cases.\n\n![Key for positive test rate example](/images_cms/test-positivity-calculate-key.jpg \"Positive test rate key\")\n\n![Positive test rate diagram for insufficient testing](/images_cms/test-positivity-calculate-high.jpg \"Positive test rate diagram for insufficient testing\")\n\nIn the first scenario, 2 out of 10 people test positive for COVID, so the positive test rate is 20%.

Our metric measures the ability of an intensive care unit (ICU) to handle a surge of COVID patients in the case of an outbreak.\n\nWhen ICU capacity is reached, not only does that make it difficult for COVID ICU patients to receive care, but non-COVID ICU patients as well.

Those beds can not be freed up, regardless of the severity of a current COVID outbreak. Even in the middle of a fall outbreak, it is not uncommon to see two-thirds of beds occupied by non-COVID patients, which is consistent with the occupancy rates estimated from pre-COVID times. We count as our denominator the number of available beds excluding those already occupied by non-COVID patients.\n\nIn the example below, there are three COVID patients, five non-COVID patients and 10 beds. A total ICU Utilization rate would be 80 percent (eight of 10 beds occupied). However, our metric focuses on COVID headroom which is 60 percent (three out of five COVID beds used). If there are no COVID patients in the ICU, our metric is 0.0 percent — even if there are non-COVID patients in the ICU.\n\n![ICU headroom diagram](/images_cms/icu-headroom-diagram.png \"ICU headroom diagram\")"

One of the best metrics of success for a contact tracing program is the percentage of new cases traced to a known source. However, very few states are reporting this number.\n\nTherefore, as a proxy, **we currently look at the number of contact tracers on staff for each state to estimate the number of contacts that could be traced within 48 hours if the contact tracing program were otherwise working perfectly**. This stems from [expert recommendations](https://covidlocal.org/assets/documents/COVID%20Local%20Metrics%20overview.pdf) that at least 90 percent of contacts for each new case must be traced within 48 hours in order to contain COVID, and expert estimations that tracing each new case within 48 hours requires an average of five contact tracers per new case, as well as fast testing.\n\nWe source our state-level tracers hired data from [Test and Trace](https://testandtrace.com/).

In addition, contact tracing is one our least refined data sets, largely because states themselves are highly variable in their reporting of contact tracing data.\n\nThe boundaries between yellow and orange are tricky.

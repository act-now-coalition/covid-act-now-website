This facilitates a unified approach with common metrics, enabling leaders at all levels to anticipate and adequately respond to their community’s COVID spread, and informing the general public on their community’s risk to COVID.

Infection rate can only track COVID growth once a positive case gets reported through the system. By then, infectious individuals have likely been COVID positive for some time, so the metric will always lag the true infection rate in the community. For example, if someone was exposed over the holidays, they likely didn’t test positive until the new year.\n2. Infection rate should be considered in context with the other metrics. Daily new cases refers to the number of new COVID infections, while the infection rate represents the trend. A place with high daily new cases may have an infection rate less than 1 and still have higher exposure than a place with relatively few, but growing, cases."

We will revisit this choice if the CDC puts out more information about general seroprevalence and the infection history of people getting vaccinated.\n2. **Vaccine variations**: We treat all vaccine manufacturers equally, e.g. our data combines people who have received the Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccines. We will re-evaluate this with any additional data, especially as more types of vaccines become available. \n3. **Timeliness**: We get our national and state data from the CDC, which does not always update daily.

Data on COVID has demonstrated that racial and ethnic minorities are often at the highest risk of poor medical outcomes.\n* **Housing & transport challenges**: Crowded housing, housing insecurity, access to indoor plumbing and limited transit options make it more difficult to avoid COVID exposure.\n* **Older age & health issues**: High-risk groups (per CDC guidelines) such as elderly adults or people with pre-existing conditions have experienced more severe health outcomes throughout the pandemic.\n* **Health system challenges**: Hospital bed availability, access to pharmacies, and the amount of healthcare spending per capita within a region, among other factors, can indicate the limited capacity of healthcare systems to respond to COVID.\n* **Crowded living & working areas**: High-risk environments, such as prisons, nursing homes, or factories, significantly contribute to a person's exposure to and vulnerability to the virus.\n* **Population density**: Higher population density has been demonstrated to increase the risk of quick viral spread and adverse health outcomes. Given its importance in understanding vulnerability to the pandemic, it comprises a specific theme in the index.\n\nSurgo Ventures sources their data from the CDC, Centers for Medicare, & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Harvard Global Health Institute, PolicyMap, the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention (NCHSTP), Kaiser Health News, Census Economic Annual Surveys, the Vera institute for Justice, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL).\n\nThe CCVI is updated whenever new research about risk factors for COVID becomes available.

      "sectionIntro": "Until Spring of 2022 when the CDC released their [community level framework](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html), Covid Act Now used three key metrics to assess a location's overall risk level—**daily new cases** (incidence), **infection rate** (RT) and **positive test rate**. The other three metrics—**ICU capacity used**, **% vaccinated** and **vulnerability**—reflected a location's ability to protect itself and recover from COVID. Below, learn more about each metric and how it was assessed.\n\nA state or county’s overall risk level took into account three metrics: daily new cases per 100K (incidence), infection rate (Rt), and test positivity. \n\n* **Daily new cases**, also known as “incidence” in epidemiology, represents the current amount of COVID in a community. \n* **Infection rate** is the direction and speed of growth. For instance, daily new cases may be low, but if infection rate is high, then we know that daily new cases will be high in the near future. \n* **Positive test rate** is a measure of confidence in the underlying data. For instance, if daily new cases and infection rate are both low, but test positivity is high, then the lack of sufficient testing suggests that we are not capturing the true levels of COVID and both daily new cases and infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported. \n\nIf a region’s daily new cases was green, then its overall risk level was green. Otherwise, a region’s overall risk level reflected the highest risk level across all three metrics.",

This framework was the result of collaboration between public health, epidemiology, and policy experts from the following organizations:"

  "pageIntro": "As of April 2022, Covid Act Now follows a 3-color COVID community risk level framework informed by 3 key metrics: \n\n* **Cases**: (weekly new reported cases per 100k)\n* **Admissions**: (weekly COVID admissions per 100k)\n* **Patients**: (% of patients with COVID of all beds).\n\nThis new framework replaces our former “U.S. COVID Risk Level” to better reflect the now decreased risk of severe illness and death from COVID due to vaccines, therapeutics, and past COVID infections, as well as other developments. \n\nIt’s based on the CDC’s [Community Level framework](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html) and its recommendations, which prioritize reducing severe illness and death, and preventing healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. Its aim is to help communities across the country live safely with the coronavirus, while also, as much as possible, returning to some version of normal life. \n\nWe are not afraid to diverge from the CDC and other frameworks, and have done so repeatedly in the past. Our objective is to provide our users with the most accurate, accessible, and actionable COVID data available. Fortunately, after evaluating the CDC’s latest framework independently and carefully with our Medical Board of Advisors, we believe it better reflects the latest state of the pandemic and have decided to align our products with it. \n\nThat said, we understand that there are some who are concerned about contracting COVID despite the reduced chances of severe illness and death, such as those who are immunocompromised, have unvaccinated children, or are concerned about long COVID. People who need extra caution can still make decisions using our older metrics, which now fall under the category of **Transmission levels**: \n\n* Daily new cases\n* Infection rate \n* Positive test rate\n\nThose metrics are still available on our site for each location and in our API. Just bear in mind that these metrics are, as previously stated, calculated using test results that do not capture unreported at-home tests that are increasingly used.",

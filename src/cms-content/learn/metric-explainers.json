For instance, daily new cases may be low, but if infection rate is high, then we know that daily new cases will be high in the near future. \n* [Positive test rate](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#positive-test-rate) is a measure of our confidence in the underlying data. For instance, if daily new cases and infection rate are both low, but test positivity is high, then the lack of sufficient testing suggests that we are not capturing the true levels of COVID and both daily new cases and infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported. \n\nEach metric is graded green, yellow, orange, or red. Incidence is the only metric for which there is a dark red, a color we added after the third surge in winter 2020, in order to capture unprecedented case counts. \n\nIf a region’s daily new cases is green, then its overall risk level is green. For instance, if the daily new cases metric is green, but test positivity is yellow, the overall risk level is still green. Otherwise, a region’s overall risk level reflects the highest risk level across all three metrics. For instance, if daily new cases and test positivity are both yellow, but infection growth is orange, then the overall risk level is orange. \n\nThe end goal is for regions to reduce cases to zero, to fully reopen their economies, and for people to resume normal lives, unrestricted by COVID or containment measures.",

If a state or county has a **high** positive test rate, it is a sign of **insufficient** testing in that area. If a state or county has a **low** positive test rate, it is a sign that we are **testing more** than only the sickest people. Testing a larger number of at-risk populations (essential workers, people notified via contact tracing , etc.) is key to catching unknown infections before they can lead to an outbreak.\n\nLet’s look at the pictures below. **There are two positive COVID tests in each of these scenarios,** but the positive test rate differs drastically due to the percentage of the population that is being tested. The closer we get to testing everyone, the less likely we are to miss positive cases.\n\n![Key for positive test rate example](/images_cms/test-positivity-calculate-key.jpg)\n\n![Positive test rate diagram for insufficient testing](/images_cms/test-positivity-calculate-high.jpg)\n\nIn the first scenario, 2 out of 10 people test positive for COVID, so the positive test rate is 20%.

Each ICU bed is staffed by specially-trained personnel and supported with special equipment, such as ventilators. Staffed ICU beds are important because they may be life-saving for some people infected by COVID. In addition, ICU beds are needed to treat not only COVID patients, but also other patients, such as people who have had a heart attack or suffered a life-threatening injury. It is important that hospitals retain enough ICU capacity to take care of both COVID and other patients requiring critical care."

However, there is variability from hospital to hospital, depending on the size of the hospital, whether the hospital is located in a rural or urban area, and other factors. For instance, a small hospital with only four ICU beds running at 75 percent full has only one bed available, whereas a larger hospital with 100 ICU beds running at 75 percent full has twenty five ICU beds available.\n\nSo smaller hospitals with only a few (three to four) staffed ICU beds typically have lower occupancy (30 to 50 percent), and generally have a system for transferring critically ill patients to larger hospitals. Meanwhile, larger hospitals tend to run leaner, with higher ICU usage (60 to 80 percent). \n\nIn general, experts agree that as ICU capacity usage approaches 15 percent, the likelihood of an abrupt outbreak overwhelming hospital systems increases. At such levels of ICU usage, NPIs (Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions), ranging from business closures to stay-at-home orders, may be needed to prevent a hospital system’s ICU from being overwhelmed, which means that it would not be able to serve patients in need of lifesaving care. For instance, in California, the [California Department of Public Health (CDPH)](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.3.20-Stay-at-Home-Order-ICU-Scenario.pdf) calls for stay-at-home orders when this 85 percent threshold is met."

Data may be lost or distorted as it is reported from hospitals to local, state, and federal agencies, such as the HHS. \n\nIn addition, the number of hospitalizations can change suddenly, such as if there is an outbreak of COVID. Such an outbreak may also lead to reporting delays, as hospital staff work to accommodate the influx of patients and prioritize lifesaving care. \n\nFurthermore, hospitals may have “surge capacity,” which refers to a healthcare system's ability to quickly expand beyond its normal capacity in order to meet a “surge, or a sudden and unexpected increase in demand for medical care. In such instances, a hospital may be able to repurpose non ICU spaces, such as hallways, cafeterias, or other wards, to increase their ICU capacity. It may also allow other hospital staff to operate ICU beds under the supervision of trained ICU staff. Thus, although the HHS reports staffed ICU beds on a daily basis, hospital capacity numbers may not always represent the complete picture given the flux in ICU capacity."

We will revisit this choice if the CDC puts out more information about general seroprevalence and the infection history of people getting vaccinated. \n2. Number of shots - We require 2 shots to consider someone as having completed vaccination. This stays close to the available science and the advice of experts, including many of our advisers. As more data becomes available we may revisit our choice but we’d rather err on the side of a stricter cutoff.\n3. Permanence of immunity - Until we know more, we assume that someone who has completed vaccination stays immune for the foreseeable future, and we do not try to estimate waning immunity. \n4. Vaccine variations - We treat all vaccine manufacturers equally, e.g. our data combines people who have received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. We will re-evaluate this with any additional data, especially as more types of vaccines become available. \n5.

In addition to data on income, employment, and education, the rate of uninsured people is also included. People without insurance tend to delay or avoid seeking health care, making them more vulnerable to severe COVID outcomes.\n* **Minorities & non-English speakers**: measures the presence of minorities and non-English speaking people within a community. The data on COVID so far has demonstrated that racial and ethnic minorities are often at the highest risk of poor medical outcomes and more likely to experience negative secondary impacts.\n* **Housing & transport challenges**: measures sub-indicators accounting for crowded housing, access to indoor plumbing, vehicle ownership, and the presence of dependents. These factors can increase vulnerability not only to primary impacts of the pandemic, but also to housing instability and limited transit options.\n* **Older age & health issues**: identifies high-risk populations (per CDC guidelines), such as elderly adults and individuals with underlying conditions, including respiratory conditions, heart conditions, obesity, diabetes, and conditions related to immunodeficiency.\n* **Health system challenges**: measures factors such as hospital bed availability, pharmacies, and healthcare spending per capita within a region, among many other variables. These aim to capture the capacity, strength, accessibility and preparedness of the healthcare system to respond to COVID. \n* **Crowded living & working areas**: measures variables within a community such as working in a high- risk industry or living in a nursing home or prison, which significantly contribute to a person's exposure to and vulnerability to the virus. \n* **Population density**: measures the number of people per unit of area. Higher population density has been demonstrated to increase the risk of quick viral spread and adverse health outcomes. Given its importance in understanding vulnerability to the pandemic, it comprises a specific theme in the index.\n\nSurgo Ventures sources their data from the CDC, Centers for Medicare, & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Harvard Global Health Institute, PolicyMap, the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention (NCHSTP), Kaiser Health News, Census Economic Annual Surveys, the Vera institute for Justice, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL).\n\nThe CCVI is updated whenever new research about risk factors for COVID becomes available. Thus far it's been updated approximately every 4-6 months, but this may change. The way the CCVI is calculated may also change in the future, for instance to take into account economic recovery."

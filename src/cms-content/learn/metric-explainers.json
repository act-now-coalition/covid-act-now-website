Safra Center for Ethics to develop the [Key Metrics for COVID Suppression](https://globalhealth.harvard.edu/key-metrics-for-covid-suppression-researchers-and-public-health-experts-unite-to-bring-clarity-to-key-metrics-guiding-coronavirus-response/) framework.\n\nCentral to this framework is our five-color COVID warning system, which communicates the severity of a location’s outbreak and offers corresponding guidance on mitigation efforts needed at each risk level. This facilitates a unified approach with common metrics, enabling leaders at all levels to anticipate and adequately respond to their community’s COVID spread, and informing the general public on their community’s risk to COVID. To develop this framework, we prioritized metrics vital to guiding suppression efforts that allow a community to safely reopen.",

Otherwise, a region’s overall risk level reflects the highest risk level across all five metrics.",

This is our highest level of COVID risk and we recommend that you take all possible precautions. \n\nThe threshold we set for our highest risk closely aligns with recommendations from the White House Task Force."

There is also no historical precedent for what is happening — this is a novel virus and disease — and our understanding of COVID continues to evolve. We, too, will continue to refine and adjust our methodology — and will make all changes open and available to you here."

          "answer": "The infection rate answers the question: “on average, how many new people will one person infect while contagious?” Daily new cases answers the question: “how many new COVID infections are in my area today?” The two metrics go hand-in-hand.\n\n**A community heading towards an outbreak has a high infection rate, but a low number of daily new cases.** The number of daily new cases per 100K will grow in the coming days because of the high infection rate.\n\nIn contrast, **a community recovering from a major outbreak has a high number of daily new cases. However, with fewer people testing positive than in the weeks prior, the infection rate is declining.** Because its infection rate is less than 1, the community’s incidence should continue to drop."

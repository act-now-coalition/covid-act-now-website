This facilitates a unified approach with common metrics, enabling leaders at all levels to anticipate and adequately respond to their community’s COVID spread, and informing the general public on their community’s risk to COVID. To develop this framework, we prioritized metrics vital to guiding suppression efforts that allow a community to safely reopen.",

      "sectionIntro": "A state or county’s community level takes into account three metrics: new COVID admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID patients, and total new COVID cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days.\n\n* [COVID admissions](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#COVID-admissions) and [patients with COVID](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#patients-with-covid) represent the current potential for health system strain.\n* [New COVID cases](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#weekly-new-cases) represents the current amount of COVID in a community and acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain.\n\nTo calculate the community level we first assign a level to each of the three metrics based on their values:\n\n* Weekly new cases: <200 is Lower, >=200 is Higher.\n* Weekly hospital admissions per 100k: <10 is Low, 10-19.9 is Medium, >=20 is High\n* Staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients: <10% is Low, 10-14.9% is Medium, >=15% is High.\n\nWe then combine the levels to get the community level as follows:\n\n* If cases are below 200 and both hospital metrics are Low, then the community level is Low.\n* If cases are above 200 and one of the hospital metrics is Medium, then the community level is High.\n* If cases are below 200 then the community level is the higher of the two hospital metrics.\n* If cases are above 200 then the community level is one level worse than the higher of the two hospital metrics. i.e. If both hospital metrics are Low then the community level is Medium. If either hospital metric is Medium or High, then the community level is High.\n\n[Read more details on the CDC's methodology.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html)\n\nCovid Act Now’s former COVID risk framework was developed in March 2020 in response to the lack of a standardized risk framework across the U.S. [Read about our former COVID risk framework.](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#former-risk-framework)"

A state may report only confirmed cases, both confirmed and probable cases separately, or the two together without specification.\n2. There are also inconsistencies when patients move across counties or when a patient’s treatment location is not reported.\n3. At-home tests are not tracked, and therefore not represented in the data.\n\nCredible data sources such as The New York Times (NYT) work to address these limitations by interpreting and verifying the data, and counting patients based on where they are being treated rather than where they live, when possible."

Infection rate can only track COVID growth once a positive case gets reported through the system. By then, infectious individuals have likely been COVID positive for some time, so the metric will always lag the true risk on the ground. For example, if someone was exposed over the holidays, they likely didn’t test positive until the new year.\n2. Infection rate should be considered in context with the other metrics. Daily new cases refers to the number of new COVID infections, while the infection rate represents the trend. A place with high daily new cases may have an infection rate less than 1 and still have higher exposure than a place with relatively few, but growing, cases."

We will revisit this choice if the CDC puts out more information about general seroprevalence and the infection history of people getting vaccinated.\n2. **Vaccine variations**: We treat all vaccine manufacturers equally, e.g. our data combines people who have received the Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccines. We will re-evaluate this with any additional data, especially as more types of vaccines become available. \n3. **Timeliness**: We get our national and state data from the CDC, which does not always update daily.

Known as the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI), this index compares states, counties, and metros across the U.S. and ranks their vulnerability relative to each other, for example with the least vulnerable county assigned a score of 0 percent, and the most vulnerable county in the U.S. with a score of 100 percent, meaning it is more vulnerable than 100 of counties in the U.S. A location’s vulnerability score looks at seven different factors: \n\n* **Unemployment & low income**: Financial insecurity, lack of access to health care, or the inability to work remotely or with protections and benefits increases vulnerability to severe COVID outcomes.\n* **Minorities & non-English speakers**: Language barriers can restrict access to public health messaging and resources. Data on COVID has demonstrated that racial and ethnic minorities are often at the highest risk of poor medical outcomes.\n* **Housing & transport challenges**: Crowded housing, housing insecurity, access to indoor plumbing and limited transit options make it more difficult to avoid COVID exposure.\n* **Older age & health issues**: High-risk groups (per CDC guidelines) such as elderly adults or people with pre-existing conditions have experienced more severe health outcomes throughout the pandemic.\n* **Health system challenges**: Hospital bed availability, access to pharmacies, and the amount of healthcare spending per capita within a region, among other factors, can indicate the limited capacity of healthcare systems to respond to COVID.\n* **Crowded living & working areas**: High-risk environments, such as prisons, nursing homes, or factories, significantly contribute to a person's exposure to and vulnerability to the virus.\n* **Population density**: Higher population density has been demonstrated to increase the risk of quick viral spread and adverse health outcomes. Given its importance in understanding vulnerability to the pandemic, it comprises a specific theme in the index.\n\nSurgo Ventures sources their data from the CDC, Centers for Medicare, & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Harvard Global Health Institute, PolicyMap, the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention (NCHSTP), Kaiser Health News, Census Economic Annual Surveys, the Vera institute for Justice, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL).\n\nThe CCVI is updated whenever new research about risk factors for COVID becomes available. Thus far it's been updated approximately every 4-6 months, but this may change. The way the CCVI is calculated may also change in the future, for instance to take into account economic recovery."

The other three metrics—**ICU capacity used**, **% vaccinated** and **vulnerability**—reflected a location's ability to protect itself and recover from COVID. Below, learn more about each metric and how it was assessed.\n\nA state or county’s overall risk level took into account three metrics: daily new cases per 100K (incidence), infection rate (Rt), and test positivity. \n\n* **Daily new cases**, also known as “incidence” in epidemiology, represents the current amount of COVID in a community. \n* **Infection rate** is the direction and speed of growth. For instance, daily new cases may be low, but if infection rate is high, then we know that daily new cases will be high in the near future. \n* **Positive test rate** is a measure of confidence in the underlying data. For instance, if daily new cases and infection rate are both low, but test positivity is high, then the lack of sufficient testing suggests that we are not capturing the true levels of COVID and both daily new cases and infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported. \n\nIf a region’s daily new cases was green, then its overall risk level was green. Otherwise, a region’s overall risk level reflected the highest risk level across all three metrics.",

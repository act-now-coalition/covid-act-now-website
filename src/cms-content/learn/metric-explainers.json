This facilitates a unified approach with common metrics, enabling leaders at all levels to anticipate and adequately respond to their community’s COVID spread, and informing the general public on their community’s risk to COVID. To develop this framework, we prioritized metrics vital to guiding suppression efforts that allow a community to safely reopen.",

For instance, daily new cases may be low, but if infection rate is high, then we know that daily new cases will be high in the near future. \n* [Positive test rate](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#positive-test-rate) is a measure of our confidence in the underlying data. For instance, if daily new cases and infection rate are both low, but test positivity is high, then the lack of sufficient testing suggests that we are not capturing the true levels of COVID and both daily new cases and infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported. \n\nEach metric has the following levels: green, yellow, orange, and red. Incidence is the only metric for which there is a dark red, a fifth color we added after the third surge in winter 2020, in order to capture unprecedented case counts. \n\nIf a region’s daily new cases is green, then its overall risk level is green. For instance, if the daily new cases metric is green, but test positivity is yellow, the overall risk level is still green. Otherwise, a region’s overall risk level reflects the highest risk level across all three metrics. For instance, if daily new cases and test positivity are both yellow, but infection growth is orange, then the overall risk level is orange. \n\nThe end goal is for regions to reduce cases to zero, to fully reopen their economies, and for people to resume normal lives, unrestricted by COVID or containment measures.",

A state may report only confirmed cases, both confirmed and probable cases separately, or the two together without specification.\n2.

Infection rate can only track COVID growth once a positive case gets reported through the system. By then, infectious individuals have likely been COVID positive for some time, so the metric will always lag the true risk on the ground. For example, if someone was exposed over the holidays, they likely didn’t test positive until the new year.\n2. Infection rate should be considered in context with the other metrics. Daily new cases refers to the number of new COVID infections, while the infection rate represents the trend. A place with high daily new cases may have an infection rate less than 1 and still have higher exposure than a place with relatively few, but growing, cases."

However, that number depends heavily on things like the overall size of the hospital and the urban or rural region it serves. For instance, a small hospital with only four ICU beds running at 75 percent of full capacity has only one bed available, whereas a larger hospital with 100 ICU beds running at 75 percent of full capacity has twenty five ICU beds available.\n\nSo smaller hospitals with only a few (three to four) staffed ICU beds typically have lower occupancy (30 percent to 50 percent), and generally have a system for transferring critically ill patients to larger hospitals. Meanwhile, larger hospitals tend to run fuller, with higher ICU usage (60 percent to 80 percent). \n\nIn general, experts agree that as ICU capacity usage approaches 85 percent, the likelihood of an abrupt outbreak overwhelming hospital systems increases. At such levels of ICU usage, NPIs ([nonpharmaceutical interventions](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#npi)), ranging from business closures to stay-at-home orders, may be needed to prevent a hospital system’s ICU from being overwhelmed, which means that it would not be able to serve patients in need of any type of lifesaving care. For instance, in California, the [California Department of Public Health (CDPH)](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.3.20-Stay-at-Home-Order-ICU-Scenario.pdf) calls for stay-at-home orders when this 85 percent threshold is met."

We will revisit this choice if the CDC puts out more information about general seroprevalence and the infection history of people getting vaccinated. \n2. **Number of shots**: For the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, we require two shots to consider someone as having completed vaccination. This stays close to the available science and the advice of experts, including many of our advisors. The J&J vaccine is designed to only require one shot to count as completed.\n3. **Permanence of immunity**: Until we know more, we assume that someone who has completed vaccination stays immune for the foreseeable future, and we do not try to estimate waning immunity. \n4. **Vaccine variations**: We treat all vaccine manufacturers equally, e.g. our data combines people who have received the Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccines. We will re-evaluate this with any additional data, especially as more types of vaccines become available. \n5. **Timeliness**: We get our national and state data from the CDC, which does not always update daily.

Data on COVID has demonstrated that racial and ethnic minorities are often at the highest risk of poor medical outcomes.\n* **Housing & transport challenges**: Crowded housing, housing insecurity, access to indoor plumbing and limited transit options make it more difficult to avoid COVID exposure.\n* **Older age & health issues**: High-risk groups (per CDC guidelines) such as elderly adults or people with pre-existing conditions have experienced more severe health outcomes throughout the pandemic.\n* **Health system challenges**: Hospital bed availability, access to pharmacies, and the amount of healthcare spending per capita within a region, among other factors, can indicate the limited capacity of healthcare systems to respond to COVID.\n* **Crowded living & working areas**: High-risk environments, such as prisons, nursing homes, or factories, significantly contribute to a person's exposure to and vulnerability to the virus.\n* **Population density**: Higher population density has been demonstrated to increase the risk of quick viral spread and adverse health outcomes. Given its importance in understanding vulnerability to the pandemic, it comprises a specific theme in the index.\n\nSurgo Ventures sources their data from the CDC, Centers for Medicare, & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Harvard Global Health Institute, PolicyMap, the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention (NCHSTP), Kaiser Health News, Census Economic Annual Surveys, the Vera institute for Justice, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL).\n\nThe CCVI is updated whenever new research about risk factors for COVID becomes available. Thus far it's been updated approximately every 4-6 months, but this may change. The way the CCVI is calculated may also change in the future, for instance to take into account economic recovery."

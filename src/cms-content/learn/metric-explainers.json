Safra Center for Ethics to develop the [Key Metrics for COVID Suppression](https://globalhealth.harvard.edu/key-metrics-for-covid-suppression-researchers-and-public-health-experts-unite-to-bring-clarity-to-key-metrics-guiding-coronavirus-response/) framework.\n\nCentral to this framework is our five-color COVID warning system, which communicates the severity of a location’s outbreak and offers corresponding guidance on mitigation efforts needed at each risk level. This facilitates a unified approach with common metrics, enabling leaders at all levels to anticipate and adequately respond to their community’s COVID spread, and informing the general public on their community’s risk to COVID. To develop this framework, we prioritized metrics vital to guiding suppression efforts that allow a community to safely reopen.",

However, with fewer people testing positive than in the weeks prior, the infection rate is declining.** Because its infection rate is less than 1, the community’s incidence should continue to drop."

We as a community can change it by modifying community behavior (whether there are large gatherings) and intervention practices (whether people wear masks and maintain social distancing).\n\n![Infection rate diagram](/images_cms/infection-rate-diagram.png \"Infection rate diagram\")"

          "answer": "In order to control COVID, the infection rate, or R(t), must be driven below 1.0 until the daily new cases metric is green. At that point community spread is effectively stopped and we can focus on controlling isolated outbreaks. **We use 0.9 as the cutoff for a green score because at that rate the number of newly infected people begins to significantly decline.** An R(t) of 1.0 means that the daily new cases of COVID are stable, while an R(t) greater than 1.0 means that daily new cases are growing."

If a state or county has a **high** test positivity rate, it is a sign of **insufficient** testing in that area. If a state or county has a **low** test positivity rate, it is a sign that we are **testing more** than only the sickest people. Testing a larger number of at-risk populations (essential workers, people notified via contact tracing , etc.) is key to catching unknown infections before they can lead to an outbreak.\n\nLet’s look at the pictures below. **There are two positive COVID tests in each of these scenarios,** but the positive test rate differs drastically due to the percentage of the population that is being tested. The closer we get to testing everyone, the less likely we are to miss positive cases.\n\n![Positive test rate diagram](/images_cms/positive-test-rate-diagram.png \"Positive test rate diagram\")"

It is important to note that positive test rate can be difficult to interpret and messy to calculate, for reasons well captured by the [Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/blog/test-positivity-in-the-us-is-a-mess).  It should be looked at in conjunction with other metrics such as infection rate and daily new cases.\n\nWe source testing data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for state level data. We scrape official state and county dashboards for county level data and, when unavailable, fall back on a weekly test positivity rate provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

South Korea was back to normal activity with a test positivity rate below 3 percent. As of November 2020, *[South Korea’s test positivity](http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/)* was 1 percent."

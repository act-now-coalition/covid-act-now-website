This facilitates a unified approach with common metrics, enabling leaders at all levels to anticipate and adequately respond to their community’s COVID spread, and informing the general public on their community’s risk to COVID. To develop this framework, we prioritized metrics vital to guiding suppression efforts that allow a community to safely reopen.",

      "sectionIntro": "### What does the overall risk level for a location mean?\n\nA state or county’s overall risk level takes into account three metrics: daily new cases per 100K (incidence), infection rate (Rt), and test positivity. \n\n* [Daily new cases](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#daily-new-cases), also known as “incidence” in epidemiology, represents the current amount of COVID in a community. \n* [Infection rate](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#infection-rate) is the direction and speed of growth. For instance, daily new cases may be low, but if infection rate is high, then we know that daily new cases will be high in the near future. \n* [Positive test rate](/covid-risk-levels-metrics#positive-test-rate) is a measure of our confidence in the underlying data. For instance, if daily new cases and infection rate are both low, but test positivity is high, then the lack of sufficient testing suggests that we are not capturing the true levels of COVID and both daily new cases and infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported. \n\nEach metric has the following levels: green, yellow, orange, and red. Incidence is the only metric for which there is a dark red, a color we added after the third surge in winter 2020, in order to capture unprecedented case counts. \n\nIf a region’s daily new cases is green, then its overall risk level is green. For instance, if the daily new cases metric is green, but test positivity is yellow, the overall risk level is still green. Otherwise, a region’s overall risk level reflects the highest risk level across all three metrics. For instance, if daily new cases and test positivity are both yellow, but infection growth is orange, then the overall risk level is orange. \n\nThe end goal is for regions to reduce cases to zero, to fully reopen their economies, and for people to resume normal lives, unrestricted by COVID or containment measures.",

A state may report only confirmed cases, both confirmed and probable cases separately, or the two together without specification.\n2.

Infection rate can only track COVID growth once a positive case gets reported through the system. By then, infectious individuals have likely been COVID positive for some time, so the metric will always lag the true risk on the ground. For example, if someone was exposed over the holidays, they likely didn’t test positive until the new year.\n2. Infection rate should be considered in context with the other metrics. Daily new cases refers to the number of new COVID infections, while the infection rate represents the trend. A place with high daily new cases may have an infection rate less than 1 and still have higher exposure than a place with relatively few, but growing, cases."

However, that number depends heavily on things like the overall size of the hospital and the urban or rural region it serves. For instance, a small hospital with only four ICU beds running at 75 percent of full capacity has only one bed available, whereas a larger hospital with 100 ICU beds running at 75 percent of full capacity has twenty five ICU beds available.\n\nSo smaller hospitals with only a few (three to four) staffed ICU beds typically have lower occupancy (30 percent to 50 percent), and generally have a system for transferring critically ill patients to larger hospitals. Meanwhile, larger hospitals tend to run fuller, with higher ICU usage (60 percent to 80 percent). \n\nIn general, experts agree that as ICU capacity usage approaches 85 percent, the likelihood of an abrupt outbreak overwhelming hospital systems increases. At such levels of ICU usage, NPIs ([nonpharmaceutical interventions](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#npi)), ranging from business closures to stay-at-home orders, may be needed to prevent a hospital system’s ICU from being overwhelmed, which means that it would not be able to serve patients in need of any type of lifesaving care. For instance, in California, the [California Department of Public Health (CDPH)](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.3.20-Stay-at-Home-Order-ICU-Scenario.pdf) calls for stay-at-home orders when this 85 percent threshold is met."

Data may be lost or distorted as it is reported from hospitals to local, state, and federal agencies, such as the HHS. \n\nThe biggest source of uncertainty in this metric is the ability for a hospital to quickly expand beyond its normal capacity to meet increased demand. This “[surge” capacity](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#surge-capacity) is difficult to predict in advance because it depends on both physical hospital resources like available beds and non-physical resources like healthy nurses and doctors to run them.\n\nHHS tries to control for this by requiring that hospitals report staffed ICU beds on a daily basis, but this doesn’t give a complete picture about theoretical surge capacity."

We will revisit this choice if the CDC puts out more information about general seroprevalence and the infection history of people getting vaccinated. \n2. **Number of shots**: For the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, we require two shots to consider someone as having completed vaccination. This stays close to the available science and the advice of experts, including many of our advisors. The J&J vaccine is designed to only require one shot to count as completed.\n3. **Permanence of immunity**: Until we know more, we assume that someone who has completed vaccination stays immune for the foreseeable future, and we do not try to estimate waning immunity. \n4. **Vaccine variations**: We treat all vaccine manufacturers equally, e.g. our data combines people who have received the Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccines.

Known as the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI), this index compares states, counties, and metros across the U.S. and ranks their vulnerability relative to each other, for example with the least vulnerable county assigned a score of 0 percent, and the most vulnerable county in the U.S. with a score of 100 percent, meaning it is more vulnerable than 100 of counties in the U.S. A location’s vulnerability score looks at seven different factors: \n\n* **Unemployment & low income**: measures the relative financial health of a community. In addition to data on income, employment, and education, the rate of uninsured people is also included. People without insurance tend to delay or avoid seeking health care, making them more vulnerable to severe COVID outcomes.\n* **Minorities & non-English speakers**: measures the presence of minorities and non-English speaking people within a community. The data on COVID so far has demonstrated that racial and ethnic minorities are often at the highest risk of poor medical outcomes and more likely to experience negative secondary impacts.\n* **Housing & transport challenges**: measures sub-indicators accounting for crowded housing, access to indoor plumbing, vehicle ownership, and the presence of dependents. These factors can increase vulnerability not only to primary impacts of the pandemic, but also to housing instability and limited transit options.\n* **Older age & health issues**: identifies high-risk populations (per CDC guidelines), such as elderly adults and individuals with underlying conditions, including respiratory conditions, heart conditions, obesity, diabetes, and conditions related to immunodeficiency.\n* **Health system challenges**: measures factors such as hospital bed availability, pharmacies, and healthcare spending per capita within a region, among many other variables. These aim to capture the capacity, strength, accessibility and preparedness of the healthcare system to respond to COVID. \n* **Crowded living & working areas**: measures variables within a community such as working in a high- risk industry or living in a nursing home or prison, which significantly contribute to a person's exposure to and vulnerability to the virus. \n* **Population density**: measures the number of people per unit of area. Higher population density has been demonstrated to increase the risk of quick viral spread and adverse health outcomes. Given its importance in understanding vulnerability to the pandemic, it comprises a specific theme in the index.\n\nSurgo Ventures sources their data from the CDC, Centers for Medicare, & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Harvard Global Health Institute, PolicyMap, the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention (NCHSTP), Kaiser Health News, Census Economic Annual Surveys, the Vera institute for Justice, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL).\n\nThe CCVI is updated whenever new research about risk factors for COVID becomes available. Thus far it's been updated approximately every 4-6 months, but this may change. The way the CCVI is calculated may also change in the future, for instance to take into account economic recovery."

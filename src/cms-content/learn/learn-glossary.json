      "definition": "Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to protect against foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria. You may have heard a lot about antibodies in the news, because they can indicate whether someone has been infected with COVID. When a person is infected with a pathogen \\[hyper link to pathogen] such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID, their body produces antibodies to help eliminate it. Serology blood tests tests \\[hyper link to Serology test definition] look for antibodies to determine whether someone has been infected with COVID in the past. Serology tests are not very useful in detecting current cases of COVID, because it can take 1-3 weeks for the body to make antibodies after being infected. [It is still unknown](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antibody-tests-guidelines.html) whether people with antibodies are protected from reinfection."

In a similar way, vaccines train your body to create antibodies and T cells to fight a disease, but without making you sick.",

There are two types of antigens: foreign antigens, which come from outside of the body, like from [viruses](#virus), and autoantigens, which come from inside the body. Usually, your immune system will not recognize autoantigens unless you have an autoimmune disease that causes your body to attack itself. Foreign antigens are the molecular structures found on the surface of viruses and include spike proteins. Your immune system responds to the presence of antigens by creating [antibodies](#antibodies) to recognize and fight the specific antigen. As the virus reproduces, mutations can occur in its spike proteins, which can make it more difficult for antibodies to recognize the virus. [Antigen tests](#antigen-test), also known as rapid tests, look for the presence of specific spike proteins to determine if someone is infected with COVID.",

Like a [PCR test](#pcr-test), an antigen test identifies people who are currently infected with COVID. It looks for proteins of the virus ([antigens](#antigen)) in someone’s nose and throat secretions using the same technology as the rapid strep test you would take at your doctor’s office.\n\nAn antigen test is very different from an [antibody test](#antibody-test), which only helps identify people who have been infected with COVID in the past.\n\nAntigen tests can provide test results in minutes, unlike PCR tests which require between several hours and several days to process results in a lab. Due to their lower cost and quick result turnaround, antigen tests are used to screen people in environments such as hospitals, workplaces, or schools, where it is important to quickly identify active infection. There is, however, concern about the accuracy of antigen testing, as the reported rate of [false negatives](#false-negative) has been [as high as 50 percent](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong).\n\nFDA authorized antigen tests can be purchased over the counter in [CVS](https://cvshealth.com/news-and-insights/press-releases/over-the-counter-covid-19-testing-now-available-at-cvs-pharmacy) and [Walgreens](https://news.walgreens.com/press-center/walgreens-makes-abbotts-binaxnow-covid-19-self-test-available-over-the-counter-at-stores-nationwide.htm) locations across the country for at-home use.",

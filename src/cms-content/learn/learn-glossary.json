    {
      "term": "Antibodies",
      "termId": "antibodies",
      "definition": "Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to protect against foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria. You may have heard a lot about antibodies in the news, because they can indicate whether someone has been infected with COVID. When a person is infected with a [pathogen](#pathogen) such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID, their body produces antibodies to help eliminate it. [Serology blood tests](#serology-test) look for antibodies to determine whether someone has been infected with COVID in the past. Serology tests are not very useful in detecting current cases of COVID, because it can take one to three weeks for the body to make antibodies after being infected. [It is still unknown](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antibody-tests-guidelines.html) whether people with antibodies are protected from reinfection."

      "term": "Antibody test",
      "termId": "antibody-test",
      "definition": "An antibody test, also known as a [serology test](#serology-test), is one of the many types of COVID tests. An antibody test looks for [antibodies](#antibodies) against COVID in the blood to determine if someone has been infected in the past, regardless of whether or not they presented with symptoms, as COVID can be [asymptomatic](#asymptomatic). This test does not identify active COVID infections, which is in contrast to PCR tests and [antigen](#antigen-test) tests. Antibody tests can be useful for tracking the spread of disease, understanding human [immunity](#immunity) to the disease, and possibly prioritizing who should be vaccinated in the future. It is [not yet known](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antibody-tests-guidelines.html) if people who have recovered from COVID and have antibodies are protected from getting reinfected."

    {
      "term": "Antigen test",
      "termId": "antigen-test",
      "definition": "An antigen test, also referred to as a rapid test, is one of many types of COVID tests. Like a [PCR test](#pcr-test), an antigen test identifies people who are currently infected with COVID. It looks for proteins of the virus in someone’s nose and throat secretions using the same technology as the rapid strep test you would take at your doctor’s office. An antigen test is very different from an [antibody test](#antibody-test), which only helps identify people who have been infected with COVID in the past. Antigen tests can provide test results in minutes, unlike PCR tests which require between several hours and several days to process results in a lab. Due to their lower cost and quick result turnaround, antigen tests could be used to screen people in environments such as hospitals, workplaces, or schools, where it is important to quickly identify active infection. There is, however, concern about the accuracy of antigen testing, as the reported rate of [false negatives](#false-negative) has been [as high as 50 percent](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong)."
    },
    {
      "term": "Asymptomatic",
      "termId": "asymptomatic",
      "definition": "An asymptomatic person is positive for the virus but never shows signs or symptoms of the infection. Testing can show asymptomatic infection. The fact that COVID can be asymptomatic means we do not always know if a person has COVID, and therefore the virus can be transmitted unknowingly. Asymptomatic transmission is one of the reasons COVID is so dangerous, as opposed to SARS, which was more deadly in infected individuals, but always symptomatic. Researchers are very unsure how many COVID cases are transmitted asymptomatically, but estimates range between [6 percent and 41 percent](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions) of cases. Some people with asymptomatic infection may actually be [presymptomatic](#presymptomatic-spread), and develop symptoms later on."
    },
    {
      "term": "Asymptomatic spread",
      "termId": "asymptomatic-spread",
      "definition": "Asymptomatic spread refers to the [transmission](#transmission) of a virus from an infected individual with no symptoms to an uninfected individual. People infected with COVID can be [asymptomatic](#asymptomatic) and therefore unaware of their ability to transmit the virus. Asymptomatic spread is one of the reasons why COVID is so dangerous. Researchers are unsure how many COVID cases fit into this category, but the World Health Organization estimates that between [6 percent and 41 percent](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions) of cases are asymptomatic."

    {
      "term": "Case density",
      "termId": "case-density",
      "definition": "Case density is a measure of the number of COVID cases divided by the number of people (per capita) in a given community. Case density can refer to new cases over, say, the last 14 days or it can refer to total cases since the onset of the pandemic. The word “density” means that the case counts are expressed as a per-capita value."
    },
    {
      "term": "Cluster event",
      "termId": "cluster-event",
      "definition": "A cluster event is a group of cases, usually at least 10 positive cases, tied to the same place at the same time. With COVID-19, large clusters result from [super spreading events](#superspreading-event) such as conferences, [choir practices](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e6.htm), funerals, and cruises. For example, in early February, 77 out of 95 of Massachusetts COVID cases could be attributed to one [biotech conference](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/03/12/coronavirus-outbreak-biogen-conference-superspreading) in Cambridge."
    },
    {
      "term": "Community spread",
      "termId": "community-spread",
      "definition": "Also referred to as “community transmission,” community spread refers to disease spread among people in a community without clear identification of when a person was [exposed](#exposed) or how the virus was [transmitted](#transmission) to them. In February, the [CDC identified](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0226-Covid-19-spread.html) a COVID patient in California who had no relevant travel history or known exposure to a patient with COVID. This discovery marked the first known instance of community spread in the United States."
    },
    {
      "term": "Comorbidity",
      "termId": "comorbidity",
      "definition": "Comorbidity is the simultaneous presence of two or more diseases or conditions in a patient. For example, a patient with diagnoses of diabetes and chronic kidney disease is considered to have comorbidities. Sometimes, the presence of comorbidities can lead to worsened prognosis, and this appears to be the case when someone is diagnosed with COVID. According to [current research](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html), conditions which are comorbid with COVID include diabetes, COPD, obesity, compromised immune systems, and certain heart conditions. Other conditions that may increase risk of severe illness from COVID include asthma, cystic fibrosis, and pregnancy."
    },
    {
      "term": "Confidence interval",
      "termId": "confidence-interval",
      "definition": "A confidence interval is used to express the degree of certainty of a statistic. It is a range of values that is likely to encompass the true value. For example, Covid Act Now reports  a statistic called [infection growth rate](#infection-growth-rate), also known as [R(t)](#rt). For each R(t) value, we also report a 90 percent confidence interval (CI). For example, if R(t) is 1.17 and has a 90 percent CI between 1.07 and 1.27, that result would be written as 90 percent CI \\[1.07, 1.27]. These numbers denote that there is a 90 percent chance that the true average infection growth rate calculated for that day is between 1.07 and 1.27."
    },
    {
      "definition": "A confirmed case, in the context of COVID reporting, is an individual who received a [PCR Test](#pcr-test) or [Antigen Test](#antigen-test) where the test result came back positive. This positive result indicates that the individual was actively infected with the [SARS-CoV-2](#sars-cov-2) virus at the time of the test. Cases can also be classified as \"possible\" or \"probable\" if identified without laboratory test results. The reporting of COVID cases normally refers to confirmed cases unless otherwise noted. The number of new cases per day, also referred to as [\"disease incidence\"](#disease-incidence), is often plotted for each day over a period of time to show how the daily new cases are trending: up, down, or steady.",

    },
    {
      "term": "Contact tracing",
      "termId": "contact-tracing",
      "definition": "Contact tracing is the process of tracing all of the people with whom a newly confirmed COVID patient has come into contact, in order to identify and notify people who may have been exposed to the virus. When contacts are efficiently traced and encouraged to quarantine, further [transmission](#transmission) can be prevented. Contact tracing is essential if we want to slow the spread of COVID without universal [quarantine](#quarantine) or full shut-down. It is especially critical due to the fact that people can spread COVID even if they are [presymptomatic](#presymptomatic-spread) or [asymptomatic](#asymptomatic). [South Korea](https://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-contact-tracing-helped-control-nightclub-outbreak-2020-5)’s robust contact tracing and testing efforts allowed the country to control COVID efficiently and effectively without a strict lock-down. If a resident tested positive or was even suspected of coming into contact with an infected person, their contacts were quickly notified, tested, and encouraged to quarantine."
    },
    {
      "term": "Containment",
      "termId": "containment",
      "definition": "Containment refers to drastically reducing the spread of disease from infected to uninfected individuals. In contrast to [mitigation](#mitigation), which aims to slow the spread of COVID, containment aims to reduce COVID spread to zero or near zero. Currently, the United States’ response to COVID is primarily focused on mitigation with some containment efforts — the goal is to mitigate the spread of COVID through public health education like CDC guidelines. In order to achieve successful containment in the United States, there would need to be widespread, high quality rapid testing in addition to measures like isolation, contact tracing, and [quarantine](#quarantine). A containment strategy was very successful in countries such as [South Korea](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/27/3/taaa039/5804843)."

      "definition": "Coronavirus is the name for a family, or category, of [viruses](#virus) that includes the new [SARS-CoV-2](#sars-cov-2) coronavirus that causes [COVID](#covid-19). There are [hundreds of coronaviruses](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses) in animals. They typically are not transmitted to humans, but in rare instances, such as with the SARS epidemic and COVID pandemic, a coronavirus can pass from an animal to a human. Coronaviruses cause a broad range of [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) including cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and fever."

      "term": "COVID-19",
      "termId": "covid-19",
      "definition": "COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the [SARS-CoV-2](#sars-cov-2) virus. \n\n* \"CO\" stands for corona, \"VI\" for virus, and \"D\" for disease. The number \"19\" refers to the year 2019 when the first case of COVID-19 was identified. \n* A confirmed case, in the context of COVID reporting, is an individual who received a [PCR Test](#pcr-test) or [Antigen Test](#antigen-test) where the test result came back positive. This positive result indicates that the individual was actively infected with the [SARS-CoV-2](#sars-cov-2) virus at the time of the test. \n* Cases can also be classified as \"possible\" or \"probable\" if identified without laboratory test results.

    {
      "term": "Crisis standards of care (CSC)",
      "termId": "crisis-standards-of-care",
      "definition": "Crisis standards of care (CSC) refers to when a hospital or healthcare system is so overwhelmed that it is impossible to provide the standard level of care. The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems across the United States, and many hospitals have to operate with limited equipment, PPE, staffing, and beds. “[Flattening the Curve](#flattening-the-curve)” is a method of slowing the spread of COVID to prevent hospitals from having to invoke crisis standards of care. Crisis standards of care often coincide with a shift from patient-centered practice, which focuses on providing the best care for a patient, to public-focused practice, which involves making decisions on patient care within a larger understanding of limited resources and collective good. An example of this is the reallocation or in some cases [sharing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/health/coronavirus-ventilator-sharing.html) of ventilators among severely ill COVID patients. [Guidelines](https://www.nursingworld.org/~496044/globalassets/practiceandpolicy/work-environment/health--safety/coronavirus/crisis-standards-of-care.pdf) have been published to help health workers and institutions navigate crisis standards of care as ethically as possible."

      "term": "Daily new cases",
      "termId": "daily-new-cases",
      "definition": "Daily new cases, also known as [disease incidence](#disease-incidence) in epidemiology, is the number of new COVID cases per day per unit of population. Covid Act Now reports “daily new cases” per 100,000 people in states and counties. This metric answers the question: “How many new infections are in my area each day?” Because we can’t test our entire population, we don’t know how many total cases are in a given population. Measuring daily new cases gives us a way to gauge new COVID cases without having to test an entire population."

    {
      "term": "Data",
      "termId": "data",
      "definition": "Data refer to quantitative bits of information or knowledge that are collected, measured, reported, and analyzed. They can be visualized using graphs or analysis tools. Data are malleable, and the process of representing, interpreting, and inferring a bigger picture from raw data constantly evolves. Collecting and analyzing COVID data is vital for understanding the state of COVID and navigating reopening decisions. [Covid Act Now](https://covidactnow.org/?s=647107) is a pandemic data platform, which acknowledges the ever-changing natures of COVID and COVID data, and chooses data sources that are accurate, credible, timely, and available. These data are then shared through user-friendly, relevant metrics and models in order to create an understanding of COVID and, ultimately, save lives."
    },
    {
      "definition": "Data smoothing refers to the process of using different statistical techniques in order to make a pattern or trend in the data more clear and visible. This process is especially important when data collection is inconsistent or convoluted, as is often the case with COVID data. Reporting agencies often skip reporting days and catch up later. These jumps represent “noise” in reporting rather than actual characteristics of the disease. We need to smooth out that reporting “noise” to better convey what is actually happening with COVID spread in a population. Two examples of these techniques are (1) removing outliers (data points that differ significantly from the other observations) from a set of data, and (2) calculating the average of the data points.",

      "term": "Demographics",
      "termId": "demographics",
      "definition": "Demographics refer to data about the characteristics of a population, such as the age, gender, income, race, education level, language, or religion of the people within a group. Analyzing the demographics of a population is an important part of understanding how COVID is affecting certain communities. The COVID pandemic has highlighted health disparities along [racial](https://covidtracking.com/race), ethnic, and economic lines in the United States. For example, Black and Latinx people are much more likely than others to be infected with COVID and to die from the disease. Although data is still sparse, we know Indigenous people and other people of color are also infected at much higher rates. The full explanations for these disparities are still being researched, but the differences are exacerbated by lower levels of health insurance coverage, distrust in the healthcare system due to a long history of discrimination in the medical field, and higher rates of underlying health conditions. There are efforts to create [tools](http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/health-profiles/Pages/COVID-19Dashboard.aspx) that better collect and understand the demographics of COVID data."

      "term": "Disease prevalence",
      "termId": "disease-prevalence",
      "definition": "Disease prevalence is a measure of the total number of cases in a community with a currently active COVID infection. It answers the question: “how many COVID infections are currently present in my area?” Disease prevalence is not the same as [disease incidence](#disease-incidence), which looks at the number of new cases in a specific time period. Disease prevalence is an indicator of the actual risk of encountering an infected individual in a community. To know the true prevalence, you would need to test the entire population (or a widespread randomized sample) every day, using a highly-accurate test. Therefore, Covid Act Now looks at disease incidence, or daily new cases per 100,000 people, to get an accurate estimation of COVID in a community."
    },

      "term": "Disease incidence",
      "termId": "disease-incidence",
      "definition": "Disease incidence is a measure of new confirmed COVID cases per day. It answers the question: “how many new COVID infections were reported in my area?” Incidence is important because it provides a snapshot of the state of COVID in a given community. Disease prevalence is another term you may have read in the news or online. Disease prevalence is not the same as disease incidence. While incidence refers to the number of new confirmed cases on a given day, prevalence refers to the total number of infections which are currently active on a given day."

      "definition": "A form of COVID [testing](#testing) in which people make an appointment at a testing facility, drive to the testing facility, and then receive either a professionally administered or self-administered test, most often a [PCR test](#pcr-test). Drive through testing allows for improved safety and efficiency in COVID testing. The person being tested never has to leave their car, reducing their potential to [expose](#exposed) someone to COVID or to be exposed to COVID. Fewer staffing is needed, and the nurses, medical assistants, and staff at the testing site are decked out with [PPE](#ppe): gloves, masks, face shields, and gowns. The in-and-out nature allows more people to be tested in a shorter period of time. Often, drive through testing sites will also have a walk-up option for people who do not have access to a car."

      "term": "Exposed",
      "termId": "exposed",
      "definition": "Exposure generally refers to the condition of being subjected to something, in this case to a [virus](#virus). If a person has come into contact with someone who has COVID, they have been exposed to COVID. They are considered exposed regardless of whether or not the person they came into contact with presents with COVID symptoms. People who have been exposed may eventually become [infected](#infection), which is why it is important to [quarantine](#quarantine) if you have been exposed to someone with COVID. [Contact tracing](#contact-tracing) is vital to identify potentially exposed people and encourage them to get tested and quarantine."

In line with [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) guidelines, there is a body of research that suggests everyone should wear a mask to protect themselves and others from COVID. COVID can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even among those who are asymptomatic\\[hyper link to asymptomatic definition] or presymptomatic\\[hyper link to presymptomatic definition], so wearing a mask can give you an added layer of protection. Since there is currently no vaccine for COVID, masks are a very important precautionary measure that everyone can take. The material used to make face masks can vary widely, but the [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) that the public wear simple cloth face coverings in public to slow virus spread."

False positives have less dangerous ramifications than false negatives. If someone who is not infected with COVID tests positive due to test inaccuracy, they may take precautions such as self-isolation. If someone infected with COVID tests negative due to test inaccuracy, they may unknowingly expose their households, friends, and community members to COVID."

By taking actions such as social distancing\\[#social-distancing], wearing masks, and staying home when you feel sick, you can do your part to flatten the curve. COVID [transmission](#transmission) will be slowed, spreading cases out over more time so that our healthcare system can handle cases better and give more people the care they need. The “curve” refers to the curves in an epidemiological chart of projected COVID cases that demonstrate the spread of the virus with and without protective measures. With protective measures, the peaks in the curve will be less steep, as cases will increase less dramatically over the same period of time."

      "definition": "A surge occurs when there is a sudden, sharp increase in the amount of cases that can grow to [overwhelm medical facilities](#surge-capacity). While a surge can refer to localized cases within a certain area, the term is also often used interchangeably with a [wave](#wave). However, surges only describe case growth while waves encompass the surge and subsequent sustained decrease in cases."

      "definition": "Surge capacity represents a health facility’s ability to evaluate and care for a sudden increase in the number of patients beyond the normal operating capacity. To calculate surge capacity, we must take into account the number of hospital beds, staff, equipment, and medical supplies currently available. By determining hospitals' current and projected capacity level, Covid Act Now attempts to help hospitals evaluate whether they will have the ability to handle an increased load of new COVID cases without having to resort to [crisis standards of care](#crisis-standards-of-care)."

      "termId": "testing",
      "definition": "Testing is a simple way to check if you are currently infected with [SARS-CoV-2](#sars-cov-2), the virus that causes COVID. The most common test, a [PCR test](#pcr-test), requires taking a swab from your nose or throat and having a medical professional determine if you are currently infected with the virus. [Antigen tests](#antigen-test) also look for active COVID infections using the same technology as the rapid streptest you would take at your doctor’s office. Antigen tests are less accurate than PCR tests, but they have a very quick result turn around of about 15 minutes. The other type of test you might have heard of is an [antibody test](#antibody-test), also known as a [serology test](#serology-test). An antibody test looks for [antibodies](#antibodies) against COVID to determine if someone has been infected in the past, regardless of whether or not they presented with symptoms. Widespread testing for active COVID infections, in conjunction with [contact tracing](#contact-tracing), is vital to slow the transmission of COVID without a vaccine. Testing allows us to identify and trace COVID cases, and encourage [exposed](#exposed) people to [quarantine](#quarantine)."

      "definition": "Test positivity, also known as the positive test rate, is the percentage of all tests performed that come back positive. Test positivity can indicate whether or not there is widespread [testing](#testing) in a given community. As the number of tests increase, the test positivity rate is expected to decrease, because tests will not be restricted to highly symptomatic cases and will therefore capture more people with few or [no symptoms](#asymptomatic). For COVID, World Health Organization (WHO) officials say a positive testing rate of [10% or less](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/22/840526338/is-the-u-s-testing-enough-for-covid-19-as-debate-rages-on-heres-how-to-know) may indicate that a community is conducting enough testing to find most cases.

      "term": "Transmission",
      "termId": "transmission",
      "definition": "Transmission is how a virus spreads from one person to another. For COVID, researchers think the [virus](#virus) is transmitted through virus particles which spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose onto another person’s eyes, mouth, or nose. COVID can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even among those who are [asymptomatic](#asymptomatic) or [presymptomatic](#presymptomatic). The existence of asymptomatic spread makes social distancing and wearing a face mask essential. The [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) that people wear a covering over their mouth and nose to protect themselves and others from COVID."

Vaccines are usually administered through needle injections, but can also be administered by mouth or sprayed into the nose. Researchers around the world are currently racing to develop a [vaccine to protect against COVID](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html). Vaccines usually take many years to develop, but [scientists](https://unfoundation.org/blog/post/qa-with-dr-peter-hotez-behind-the-scenes-of-covid-19-vaccine-research/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1uWkppzD6gIVhYbACh2drgkiEAAYASAAEgLiXvD_BwE) are trying to produce a safe and effective vaccine in 12 to 18 months.

      "termId": "ventillator",
      "definition": "A ventilator is a machine that helps patients breathe when they cannot do so on their own. People whose lungs are severely damaged by COVID may use a ventilator because they cannot get enough oxygen on their own. While ventilators allow lungs to heal, they are not in and of themselves a treatment. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds are equipped with ventilators, which may save the lives of the sickest COVID patients. [ICU Headroom](icu-headroom) is one of Covid Act Now’s main metrics for understanding the state of COVID in a region, since measuring and predicting ICU capacity gives a picture of whether hospitals can handle an increased load of new COVID cases without having to resort to [crisis standards of care](#crisis-standards-of-care)."

      "definition": "A virus is an infectious agent that cannot live on its own for an extended period of time outside of a host organism. [SARS-CoV-2](#sars-cov-2) is the virus that causes COVID. In order to survive and replicate, viruses must infect cells and make copies of themselves, often killing host cells in the process and causing damage to the host organism. [Coronaviruses](#coronavirus) are a family of viruses found in both animals and humans. There are currently seven coronaviruses known to infect humans. SARS-CoV-2 is one of those seven. It is important to note that viruses are not bacteria, and cannot be killed with antibiotics."

COVID cases seem to come in waves: first wave, second wave, and so on. There is no official definition of when one wave ends and another begins, and COVID has peaked in different states at different times. [Data suggests](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/15/us/coronavirus-cases-us-surge.html) the U.S. on the whole experienced its first peak mid April, second peak in mid July, and is now entering its third wave of cases. The term wave is often used alongside or interchangeably with [surge](#surge), which describes the increase in cases seen before and during the peak of a wave."

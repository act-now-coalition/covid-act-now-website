Local decision makers lack a shared understanding of COVID metrics and indicators. They also lack the granular data necessary to accurately assess the pandemic in local communities. \n\nHinds believes that even if policy interventions are in place, actual community and individual behavior may not follow along, especially when a lack of understanding and trust in the numbers leads to a lack of understanding and trust in the policy decisions that are being made. \n\nThe public requires tools to better understand COVID data, and Hinds seeks to bridge that gap.

She earned a Masters in Public Health from Yale in 2019.\n\nIn her role as the Planning Section Chief for District 5 of [Oklahoma](https://covidactnow.org/us/oklahoma-ok?s=1226301), which has about 250,000 people from the counties of Beckham, Caddo, Comanche, Cotton, Greer, Harmon, Jackson, Kiowa, Tillman, and Washita, Curry must effectively understand and communicate the local COVID situation to government officials and health workers in order to help guide state and county-level responses to COVID outbreaks. \n\nData, models and visualizations are a part of her day-to-day responsibilities, whether in daily “tactics meetings” with members of the Incidence Command Center; in speaking to public health nurses during morning briefings; or when providing insights to the state governor.\n\n## What are the challenges?\n\nThe challenges that Curry faces in communicating the local COVID situation are numerous. When presenting data-heavy models and visualizations to officials that often do not have a background in epidemiology, **it can be difficult to articulate in simple and accessible terms the severity of the local COVID situation.** \n\nIn addition to their lack of public health background, these officials are **wary of COVID models and visualizations that appear to be politicized in any way**, and that may therefore be biased. \n\nIn-house COVID models may be messy and lack the credibility needed to guide decision makers on how to respond to state-wide outbreaks of COVID. \n\n## How is the Oklahoma State Department of Health responding to COVID? \n\nCurry uses Covid Act Now to communicate the local COVID situation to government officials and health workers in a way that is easy-to-understand, accurate, apolitical, and county-specific. \n\nAs Curry explains, “I think the Covid Act Now model looks a lot neater than mine does. It’s a lot more user friendly because mine looks crazy so people get a little scared. So if I’m doing any model projection, as Planning Chief for our Incidence Command Center, I’ll use your model, I’ll take a screenshot and show people what’s going on, or I’ll pull it up and screen share.”\n\n> “I’ve introduced this to my public health nurses, to my boss, my regional director. . . it has gotten a lot of positive feedback.”\n\nUsing a tool that gets to the point quickly by presenting credible, user-friendly, county-level COVID information, Curry has received enthusiastic reactions from people both inside and outside her network. As she explains it, “Everyone honestly that I have presented this website to has been very enthusiastic about it. I’ve introduced this to my public health nurses, to my boss, my regional director...I’ve also introduced it to my cohort from Yale, I still keep in touch with them just to pull info from if I need it, but I sent it out to them and they have since passed it on to others, so it has gotten a lot of positive feedback.”",

          "body": "In early March, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) brought together a team of data scientists and public health officials to create a data tool for driving policy and public health actions in [California](http://covidactnow.org/us/california-ca). The goal was to create an ensemble view of the best COVID models available in order to facilitate comparison, discussion and clarity about pandemic trends. \n\nOn June 25, CDPH launched the [California COVID Assessment Tool](https://calcat.covid19.ca.gov/cacovidmodels/) (CalCAT), a “model of models” and the first state dashboard of its kind in the country. CalCAT has been used by state and county officials alike, setting the standard for COVID data collection in America.\n\n## What is the challenge?\n\nIn creating CalCAT, the CDPH team sought to answer three key questions: \n\n1. How fast is COVID spreading today? (Specifically, what is the infection growth rate?)\n2. At this rate of spread, what would we expect in the next two to four weeks if no action were taken? \n3. What are the long-term impacts of the different actions we could take? \n\nDecision making during a pandemic is infinitely complex. To determine the best course of action, decision makers must weigh a host of economic, social and cultural variables. For instance, if businesses are asked to shut down, the livelihoods of individuals and families could be imperiled; closing schools could hinder not only education but also the safety and nutrition of students; vulnerable communities — at risk due to age, race or socioeconomic status — could experience greater impacts. Compliance is also a concern. Some polls show that [only 64 percent of people](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/26/politics/maskwearing-coronavirus-analysis/index.html) in California complied with the [state’s mask mandate](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf) in June.\n\nCalCAT’s mandate was to provide decision makers with reliable, trustworthy, and useful information from a public health perspective. To do so, CalCAT realized it could not rely on any one, single model. Rather, it aggregated a range of models and vetted them for granularity, objectivity, and credibility.\n\n> CalCAT realized it could not rely on any one, single model. Rather, it aggregated a range of models and vetted them for granularity, objectivity, and credibility.\n\nThe emphasis on granular (e.g., county-level) data was particularly challenging, since many COVID models provide only state-level forecasts. Yet the CDPH team knew that county-level information would be critical; California is a large and diverse state. San Francisco and Sonoma county are neighbors, just 45 miles apart, yet face drastically different considerations: San Francisco has a density of about [18,000 people per square mile](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/entity/1600000US0667000/San_Francisco_CA/geographic.population.density?year=2018), while Sonoma County has only [300 per square mile](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/entity/0500000US06097-0500000US06067/Sonoma_County_CA-Sacramento_County_CA/geographic.population.density?year=2018); San Francisco’s major industries are technology and manufacturing, while Sonoma County’s are hospitality and agriculture; [San Francisco](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/sanfranciscocountycalifornia) has a high proportion of immigrants, while [Sonoma County](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/sonomacountycalifornia) does not. \n\nIn addition, CDPH wanted to look at forecasts of both hospitalizations and deaths. Many models provide only one or the other, but both were important to the CDPH. Projected hospitalizations paint a picture of COVID’s spread and help decision makers think about the allocation of resources, such as hospital staff and supplies. Projected deaths, on the other hand, paint a picture of, and may speak to long-term policies that affect the quality of care that patients receive. \n\nAnother consideration is that hospitalizations may provide more timely information on the spread of COVID; besides the fact that hospitalizations generally precede fatalities, there tend to be heavy lags in the reporting of deaths. To record a confirmed COVID death requires a complete death certificate, and a complete death certificate has three components. First, the certificate must be filled out by a doctor, hospital staff or a medical examiner’s office depending on where a person dies. There can be slow-downs here due to the overburdening of our healthcare system. Secondly, the certificate is filled out by the funeral home. Thirdly, the certificate is filled out by the family, and there may be additional delays here, if there are difficulties identifying family members. Even when family members are identified, they may not be prepared to fill out paperwork during the grieving process. \n\nOn the other hand, data on deaths tends to be more reliable than data on hospitalizations. Due to the heavy burden being upheld by healthcare systems, reporting is subject to error, and many COVID hospitalizations may not be recorded. It’s also worth noting that hospitalizations are likely a small fraction of the total number of COVID cases, with some estimates that actual COVID cases are 12x the number of reported hospitalizations.\n\n## How is CalCAT Responding to COVID?\n\nThe Covid Act Now (CAN) model fulfills two unique requirements: (1) county-level forecasts, (2) forecasts of hospitalizations and deaths.\n\n![calcat-hospitalizations](/images_cms/calcat-hospitalizations.png \"CalCAT Forecasts for Hospitalizations\")\n\n*On CalCAT’s tool, they use CAN models to forecast COVID hospitalizations in a county when shelter-in-place policies are implemented (teal) and when social distancing policies are implemented (purple)*\n\n![calcat-cumulative-deaths](/images_cms/calcat-cumulative-deaths.png \"CalCAT Forecasts for Cumulative Deaths\")\n\n*On CalCAT’s tool, they use CAN models to forecast COVID deaths in a county when shelter-in-place policies are implemented (teal) and when social distancing policies are implemented (purple).*\n\nToday, CalCAT integrates CAN into its nowcasts and forecasts, enabling decision makers to understand the current spread of COVID, project the spread over the next few weeks, and model the impact of various policy interventions. By incorporating CAN data and resources, CalCAT can give insight into the current state of COVID in each county, and model how these counties will look in the future depending on the types of policies that are put in place. CAN also plays an essential role in providing the data to understand the effects of shelter-in-place and distancing policies. This tool is invaluable for California policymakers, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who uses the data from CalCAT to make informed decisions that help keep the 39 million Californians safe. \n\n> By incorporating CAN data and resources, CalCAT can give insight into the current state of COVID in each county, and model how these counties will look in the future depending on the types of policies that are put in place.",

She also held program management and policy analyst positions with state government agencies. While completing her doctorate in health care management and policy, Aguillard worked at the Texas Medical Center Health Policy Institute, translating complex policy topics into understandable and actionable recommendations and deliverables for diverse stakeholders.* \n\n*In her current role as a senior policy planner (COVID-19 Response), Aguillard provides frequent updates to support equitable testing strategies for Harris County Public Health. Additionally, Aguillard produces outreach documents that are shared internally and to community partners. These documents support the disability community with updated guidance on the evolving COVID situation. For instance, she produced a one-pager that instructs staff at testing sites how to serve the disability community with respect during the testing process. Finally, Aguillard conducts literature scans to identify scientific updates in testing (such as evidence related to antigen and antibody testing) and best practices to reach and engage underserved populations.*\n\n## What is the challenge?\n\nAs a blind researcher providing both internal and external guidance on COVID, Aguillard needs resources that are accessible and optimized for someone using assistive technology like screen readers, which translate on-screen text into audio, one of the premier assistance tools for visually impaired internet users.

Since the onset of COVID, NACo has deployed tools and resources to help county officials track their own local COVID situation and navigate reopening decisions.*\n\n## What is the challenge?\n\nNACo’s mission is to strengthen America’s counties, but counties across the United States vary greatly in terms of size and resources; they range from New York City, home to 1.6 million Manhattanites, to rural counties in the West with fewer than a 1,000 residents. For this reason, when it comes to COVID reporting and data analysis, county officials have widely varying resources and needs, and NACo cannot offer one-size-fits-all solutions.\n\nIn order to support its broad range of members, NACo needs a diverse set of tools and resources to encourage data-backed decisions amidst COVID. To combat the pandemic, county officials have to make many important policy decisions, including guidance on mask-wearing, social gatherings, and local business openings, and how to allocate health resources. There is an overwhelming amount of publicly available data that is inconsistent and contradictory, making these decisions all the more difficult, particularly since every county has experienced COVID differently.\n\nNACo’s county resources and tools, then, need to be robust and evidence-based, but also relevant for hyper-local decision making.\n\n## How is NACo responding to COVID?\n\nCovid Act Now (CAN) was able to fill the need for a powerful, localized tool with its **[COVID Response Simulator (CRS)](https://covidactnow.org/covid-response-simulator-redirect)**. \n\nThe CRS allows users to view the potential impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as mask-wearing and closing schools, on COVID statistics like case numbers and hospitalizations.

Looking at a market’s COVID risk level will be an important consideration for hiring and managing overall risk.” \n\nSince incorporating Covid Act Now’s data and API into its list of filters, BeyondHQ has seen a notable increase in user interaction.",

          "body": "IBM is a leading global technology and consulting company that works with clients to tackle some of the world's most complex and challenging issues. \n\nThe company is now dedicated to developing and sharing resources to address the pandemic. IBM works with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to aid in its disaster and humanitarian response to COVID-19. IBM helps the DoD understand and anticipate medical shortages, food shortages, and supply chain breakages, so that directed DoD units can be prepared to provide timely support and minimize damage to local communities.\n\n## What is the challenge?\n\nIBM has not historically been focused on pandemic modeling. It therefore sought to quickly identify an existing model that offers credible and reliable nowcasting and forecasting of COVID in the U.S. at the county level. \n\nIBM needs a model that includes critical public health information such as infection growth rate, hospital capacity, and hospital utilization. Without a strong COVID modeling system, IBM would be unable to support the DoD to provide directed units and organizations with the key information necessary to infer and predict where COVID outbreaks and resource shortages will occur. IBM needs to share a model that assesses non-health data inputs, such as food security and social unrest, and also allows the DoD units to get a picture of what is happening on the ground in order to direct resources and attention to the places that need them.\n\n## How is IBM responding to COVID?\n\nIBM chose to use the Covid Act Now (CAN) model over other available models to power the disease progression portion of its project with the DoD. With CAN, IBM is able to present the DoD with one model that combines multiple sources in a clear, digestible format. IBM chose CAN’s model because it collects data from many different sources automatically on a regular basis. CAN is the only model to calculate COVID’s infection growth rate at the county level. It also provides great estimates for hospital bed, ICU, and ventilator usage by COVID patients. IBM worked closely to create displays of CAN’s county-level R(t) and infection counts at current day, as well as forecasted 4, 8, 12, and 28 days into the future. In addition, IBM is able to share county level forecasts on medical supply shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. This data directly affects how and where the DoD responds to the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future humanitarian and disaster relief missions. \n\nIBM developed additional models that use other data inputs affected by the spread of COVID, such as unemployment, income, and the price of food, to predict the food gap, using data provided by Feeding America and the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. Another model looks at the potential disruption in the food supply chain. For that model, the likelihood of businesses shutting down and their typical supply is considered. The effect of population dispersion due to severe weather events is also being investigated.\n\nIBM uses CAN in collaboration with the DoD and Feeding America to point the DoD towards counties that may experience hospital capacity or food shortages due to COVID. The collaboration between CAN, IBM, and therefore the DoD continues to evolve with the COVID response. In early July, IBM presented CAN data on ICU and hospital capacity to the White House COVID Task Force.\n\n> **“We’ve realized that your model gives us the best estimate of how many ICU beds, regular hospital beds, and ventilators are being taken up by COVID patients, so that was a huge plus for us.”**\n>\n> “We gave a presentation to White House Coronavirus task force yesterday and we showed data from your model.”",

          "body": "*Jack Wheeler is the county manager of [Steuben County](https://covidactnow.org/us/ny/county/steuben_county?s=1273304), a small rural county in western New York with a population of 95,000 people.* \n\n*In this position, he also doubles as the chief executive officer of the county and is appointed by the local legislature to act on its behalf in implementing county policy. As the liaison between the county’s administration and legislature, Wheeler coordinates with the standing committees of the legislature to implement policy. He also aids the clerk of the legislature and county attorney to develop the legislative agenda, and he creates the county budget.* \n\n*Because his duties are intertwined with policy administration, he plays a critical role in overseeing, analyzing, and adjusting Steuben County’s COVID response.*  \n\n*Because Steuben County became a “hotspot” in April when a nursing home detected 50 new COVID cases in a single day, it became the most impacted rural county in the state with a death rate disproportionate to the size of the community. Despite containing COVID to under 400 total cases through late September, the area has seen another spike to 600 total cases in early October.*\n\n## What is the challenge?\n\nThe greatest challenge Wheeler faces in response to COVID is to find effective ways to interpret and explain COVID data to his department and community. He needs clear COVID data to help him with everything from advising employees on their travel plans to showing wearied citizens how mask mandates and limits on gathering size help slow the spread of the disease. \n\nAs economies begin to open back up and travel resumes, he needs a tool that can clearly indicate whether an employee’s travel destination is safe, especially if it is not included in New York’s travel ban. \n\nMost of Steuben County’s COVID communications to the public come from the state, but Wheeler has found that the state does not provide adequate data to back up decisions it makes. To ensure clear and effective messaging to the public and avoid another outbreak, Wheeler began searching for a tool that could complement and substantiate COVID-related policies made on the state and county levels.\n\n## How is Steuben County responding to COVID?\n\n> “Our team of public health and emergency management officials utilize the Covid Act Now dashboards daily to gain additional operational awareness of virus transmission. The tool provides key metrics that help to educate our team and inform our decision making as we navigate this pandemic on the local level.”\n\nWheeler checks the Covid Act Now website daily to create advisories about where county employees can safely travel. CAN’s county-level data has been instrumental in helping Wheeler track down travel-related COVID cases in Steuben County. When employees make plans to travel to a state not included in New York’s travel ban, they use CAN to look at the infection rate in that area to determine the risk involved with their travel. \n\nWheeler finds CAN most helpful for informational intelligence so that when he sends out state, federal, and local messaging on COVID to his community, he can use CAN to back up his recommendations. He recognizes that community adherence to mitigation strategies is largely dependent on trust and public understanding of the pandemic, so using CAN data in his messaging helps him gain community support in combating COVID.\n\n>  “It really is the most useful tracking tool that I've seen out there.

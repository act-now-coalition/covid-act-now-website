          "body": "In early March, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) brought together a team of data scientists and public health officials to create a data tool for driving policy and public health actions in California. The goal was to create an ensemble view of the best COVID models available in order to facilitate comparison, discussion, and clarity about pandemic trends. \n\nOn June 25, CDPH launched the [California COVID Assessment Tool](https://calcat.covid19.ca.gov/cacovidmodels/) (CalCAT), a “model of models” and the first state dashboard of its kind in the country. CalCAT has been used by state and county officials alike, setting the standard for COVID data collection in America.\n\n## **What** is the challenge?\n\nIn creating CalCAT, the CDPH team sought to answer three key questions: \n\n1. How fast is COVID spreading in [California](https://covidactnow.org/us/california-ca?s=1279305) today? (Specifically, what is the [infection growth rate](/glossary#infection-growth-rate)?)\n2. At this rate of spread, what would we expect in the next two to four weeks if no action were taken? \n3. What are the long-term impacts of the different actions we could take? \n\nDecision making during a pandemic is infinitely complex. To determine the best course of action, decision makers must weigh a host of economic, social and cultural variables. For instance, if businesses are asked to shut down, the livelihoods of individuals and families could be imperiled; closing schools could hinder not only education but also the safety and nutrition of students; vulnerable communities — at risk due to age, race or socioeconomic status — could experience greater impacts. Compliance is also a concern. Some polls show that [only 64 percent of people](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/26/politics/maskwearing-coronavirus-analysis/index.html) in California complied with the [state’s mask mandate](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf) in June.\n\nCalCAT’s mandate is to provide decision makers with reliable, trustworthy, and useful information from a public health perspective. To do so, CalCAT realized it could not rely on any one, single model. Rather, it aggregated a range of models and vetted them for granularity, objectivity, and credibility.\n\n> CalCAT realized it could not rely on any one, single model. Rather, it aggregated a range of models and vetted them for granularity, objectivity, and credibility.\n\nThe emphasis on granular (e.g., county-level) data was particularly challenging, since many COVID models provide only state-level forecasts. Yet the CDPH team knew that county-level information would be critical; California is a large and diverse state. San Francisco and Sonoma County are neighbors, just 45 miles apart, yet face drastically different considerations: San Francisco has a density of about [18,000 people per square mile](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/entity/1600000US0667000/San_Francisco_CA/geographic.population.density?year=2018), while Sonoma County has only [300 per square mile](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/entity/0500000US06097-0500000US06067/Sonoma_County_CA-Sacramento_County_CA/geographic.population.density?year=2018); San Francisco’s major industries are technology and manufacturing, while Sonoma County’s are hospitality and agriculture; San Francisco has a [high proportion of immigrants](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/sanfranciscocountycalifornia), while Sonoma County [does not](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/sonomacountycalifornia). \n\nIn addition, CDPH wanted to look at forecasts of both hospitalizations and deaths. **Many models provide only one or the other, but both were important to the CDPH**. Projected hospitalizations paint a picture of COVID’s spread and help decision makers think about the allocation of resources, such as hospital staff and supplies. Projected deaths, on the other hand, paint a picture of the quality of care that patients receive, and may point to a need for adopting new policies.\n\nAnother consideration is that hospitalizations may provide more timely information on the spread of COVID; besides the fact that hospitalizations generally precede fatalities, there are often heavy lags in the reporting of deaths. To record a confirmed COVID death requires a complete death certificate, and a complete death certificate has three components. First, the certificate must be filled out by a doctor, hospital staff or a medical examiner’s office, depending on where a person dies. There can be slow-downs due to the overburdening of our healthcare system. Second, the certificate is filled out by the funeral home. Third, the certificate is filled out by the family. Difficulties identifying family members may lead to additional delays. Even when family members are identified, they may not be prepared to fill out paperwork during the grieving process.\n\nOn the other hand, data on deaths tends to be more reliable than data on hospitalizations. Due to the heavy burden being upheld by healthcare systems, reporting is subject to error, and many COVID hospitalizations may not be recorded. It’s also worth noting that hospitalizations are likely a small fraction of the total number of COVID cases, with some estimates that actual COVID cases are 12x the number of reported hospitalizations.\n\n## How is the California Department of Public Health responding to COVID?\n\nThe Covid Act Now (CAN) model fulfills two unique requirements: (1) county-level forecasts, (2) forecasts of hospitalizations and deaths.\n\n![California County Hospitalization Forecasts: Graph of CalCAT hospitalization forecasts for Alameda County, which uses Covid Act Now as one of its models](/images_cms/alameda-calcat-forecasts.png \"CalCAT Forecasts for COVID Hospitalizations\")\n\n*Covid Act Now is one of the key models, including Johns Hopkins, UCLA, and IHME, that the CDPH’s CalCAT tool uses in their **county-level forecasting for COVID hospitalizations**, pictured here, as well as COVID deaths.* \n\n![R-effective trends by County: Graph of CalCAT nowcasts for R-effective trends in Alameda County using a variety of models, including Covid Act Now's. ](/images_cms/calcat-alameda-nowcasts-reff.png \"CalCAT Nowcasts for R-effective\")\n\n*CalCAT's county-level **nowcasting also uses CAN in illustrating trends in R(t)**, which tells us how fast COVID is spreading in the county by measuring the average number of people each infected person goes on to infect.*\n\nToday, CalCAT integrates CAN into its [nowcasts](/glossary#nowcasting) and [forecasts](/glossary#forecasting), enabling decision makers to understand the current spread of COVID, project the spread over the next few weeks, and model the impact of various policy interventions. By incorporating CAN data and resources, CalCAT can give insight into the current state of COVID in each county, and model how these counties will look in the future, depending on the types of policies that are put in place. CAN also plays an essential role in providing the data to understand the effects of stay-at-home and distancing policies. This tool is invaluable for California policymakers, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who uses the data from CalCAT to make informed decisions that help keep the 39 million Californians safe. \n\n> By incorporating CAN data and resources, CalCAT can give insight into the current state of COVID in each county, and model how these counties will look in the future, depending on the types of policies that are put in place.",

In this role, Curry must have a clear picture of the local COVID situation in order to communicate effectively with government officials and health workers and guide them in their state and county-level responses to COVID outbreaks. \n\nData, models and visualizations are a part of her day-to-day responsibilities, whether in daily “tactics meetings” with members of the Incidence Command Center; in speaking to public health nurses during morning briefings; or when providing insights to the state governor.\n\n## **What** are the challenges?\n\nThe challenges that Curry faces in communicating about the local COVID situation are numerous. When presenting data-heavy models and visualizations to officials who often do not have a background in epidemiology, **it can be difficult to articulate the severity of the local COVID situation in simple and accessible terms.** \n\nIn addition to their lack of public health background, these officials are **wary of COVID models and visualizations that appear to be politicized in any way** and that may therefore be biased. \n\nIn-house COVID models may be messy and lack the credibility needed to guide decision makers on how to respond to state-wide outbreaks of COVID. \n\n## **How** is Curry responding to COVID? \n\nCurry uses Covid Act Now (CAN) to communicate the local [COVID situation in Oklahoma](https://covidactnow.org/us/oklahoma-ok?s=1279305) to government officials and health workers in a way that is easy-to-understand, accurate, apolitical, and county-specific. \n\nAs Curry explains, “I think the Covid Act Now model looks a lot neater than mine does. It’s a lot more user friendly because mine looks crazy so people get a little scared. So if I’m doing any model projection, as planning chief for our Incidence Command Center, I’ll use your model, I’ll take a screenshot and show people what’s going on, or I’ll pull it up and screen share.”\n\n> “I’ve introduced this to my public health nurses, to my boss, my regional director. . . it has gotten a lot of positive feedback.”\n\nCurry has received enthusiastic reactions from people both inside and outside her network. They like the fact that CAN's tool gets to the point quickly by presenting credible, user friendly COVID information at a county level. As Curry explains it, “Honestly, everyone that I have presented this website to has been very enthusiastic about it. I’ve introduced this to my public health nurses, to my boss, my regional director...I’ve also introduced it to my cohort from Yale...I sent it out to them and they have since passed it on to others, so it has gotten a lot of positive feedback.”",

Prior to this role, Aguillard worked for non-profit organizations to support safety net services and address social determinants of health, such as housing stability and food security. She also held program management and policy analyst positions with state government agencies. While completing her doctorate in health care management and policy, Aguillard worked at the Texas Medical Center Health Policy Institute, translating complex policy topics into understandable and actionable recommendations and deliverables for diverse stakeholders. \n\nIn her current role as a senior policy planner (COVID-19 Response), Aguillard provides frequent updates to support equitable testing strategies for Harris County Public Health. Additionally, Aguillard produces outreach documents that are shared internally and with community partners. These documents support the disability community with updated guidance on the evolving COVID situation. For instance, she produced a one-pager that instructs staff at testing sites how to serve the disability community with respect during the testing process. Finally, Aguillard conducts literature scans to identify scientific updates in testing (such as evidence related to antigen and antibody testing) and best practices to reach and engage underserved populations.\n\n## **What** is the challenge?\n\nAs a blind researcher providing both internal and external guidance on COVID, Aguillard needs resources that are accessible and optimized for someone using assistive technology like screen readers, which translate on-screen text into audio and are one of the premier assistance tools for visually impaired internet users.

Through our interactions with Aguillard, the CAN team has been learning more about how to develop our highly visual site, in a way that remains accessible for those who may be visually impaired. \n\nThe CAN team has learned how small and simple things like **adding text descriptions** can help visuals like graphs and charts remain accessible to traditional assistance tools, such as screen readers. Other examples of best practices include **adding transcripts for audio content** to accommodate hearing impaired users, or **using color with care to ensure that colorblind individuals can still understand the meaning of content** without seeing the coloring. \n\nConducting regular “accessibility audits,” following best-practice literature, and communicating with individuals who experience impairments should be prioritized to make sure websites can be used by all. \n\n**Best practice resources for website accessibility — provided by Kimberly Aguillard** \n\n* “[8 Website Accessibility Best Practices to Improve UX](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/8-website-accessibility-best-practices-to-improve-ux/)” by UX Pin\n* “[Web Design Accessibility Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)” by W3C \n* “[Top 10 Tips for Making Your Website Accessible](https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility)” by UC Berkeley\n* “[Best Practices for ADA Website Compliance in 2020](https://medium.com/@krisrivenburgh/best-practices-for-ada-website-compliance-in-2020-e015ba65e231)” by Kris Rivenburgh",

IBM works with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to aid in its disaster and humanitarian response to COVID. IBM helps the DoD understand and anticipate medical shortages, food shortages, and supply chain breakages so that directed DoD units can be prepared to provide timely support and minimize damage to local communities.\n\n## **What** is the challenge?\n\nIBM historically has not focused on pandemic modeling. It therefore sought to quickly identify an existing model that offers credible and reliable [nowcasting](/glossary#nowcasting) and [forecasting](/glossary#forecasting) of COVID in the U.S. at the county level. \n\nIBM needs a model that includes critical public health information such as **[infection growth rate](/glossary#infection-growth-rate), hospital capacity, and hospital utilization**. Without a strong COVID modeling system, IBM would be unable to support the DoD to provide directed units and organizations with the key information necessary to infer and predict where COVID outbreaks and resource shortages will occur. IBM needs to share a model that assesses non-health data inputs, such as food security and social unrest, and also allows the DoD units to get a picture of what is happening on the ground in order to direct resources and attention where they are needed.\n\n## **How** is IBM responding to COVID?\n\nIBM chose to use the Covid Act Now (CAN) model over other available models to power the disease progression portion of its project with the DoD. With CAN, **IBM is able to present the DoD with one model that combines multiple sources in a clear, digestible format**. IBM chose CAN’s model because it collects data from many different sources automatically on a regular basis. CAN is the only model to calculate COVID’s infection growth rate at the county level. It also provides great estimates for hospital bed, ICU, and ventilator usage by COVID patients. IBM worked closely to create displays of CAN’s county-level R(t) and infection counts at current day, as well as forecasted four, eight, 12, and 28 days into the future. In addition, IBM is able to share county-level forecasts on medical supply shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. **This data directly affects how and where the DoD responds to the current COVID pandemic, as well as future humanitarian and disaster relief missions**. \n\n> “We’ve realized that your model gives us the best estimate of how many ICU beds, regular hospital beds, and ventilators are being taken up by COVID patients, so that was a huge plus for us.”\n\nIBM developed additional models that use other data inputs, including unemployment, income, and the price of food, which have been affected by COVID. This data, provided by Feeding America and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, helps predict the food gap. Another model looks at the potential disruption in the food supply chain by taking into account the likelihood of businesses shutting down. IBM is also investigating the effect of population dispersion due to severe weather events.\n\nIBM uses CAN in collaboration with the DoD and Feeding America to point the DoD towards counties that may experience hospital capacity or food shortages due to COVID. The collaboration between CAN, IBM, and therefore the DoD continues to evolve with the COVID response. In early July, IBM presented CAN data on ICU and hospital capacity to the White House COVID Task Force.\n\n> “We gave a presentation to White House Coronavirus task force yesterday and we showed data from your model.”",

As the liaison between the county’s administration and legislature, Wheeler coordinates with the standing committees of the legislature to implement policy. He also aids the clerk of the legislature and county attorney to develop the legislative agenda, and he creates the county budget. \n\nBecause his duties are intertwined with policy administration, he plays a critical role in overseeing, analyzing, and adjusting Steuben County’s COVID response.  \n\nBecause Steuben County became a [hotspot](/glossary#hotspot) in April when a nursing home detected 50 new COVID cases in a single day, it became the most impacted rural county in the state with a death rate disproportionate to the size of the community. Despite containing COVID to under 400 total cases through late September, the area has seen another spike to 600 total cases in early October.\n\n## **What** is the challenge?\n\nThe greatest challenge Wheeler faces in response to COVID is to find effective ways to interpret and explain COVID data to his department and community. He needs clear COVID data to help him with everything from advising employees on their travel plans to showing wearied citizens how mask mandates and limits on gathering size help slow the spread of the disease. \n\nAs economies begin to open back up and travel resumes, he needs a tool that can clearly indicate whether an employee’s travel destination is safe, especially if it is not included in New York’s travel ban. \n\nMost of Steuben County’s COVID communications to the public come from the state, but Wheeler has found that the state does not provide adequate data to back up decisions it makes. To ensure clear and effective messaging to the public and avoid another outbreak, Wheeler began searching for a tool that could complement and substantiate COVID-related policies made on the state and county levels.\n\n## **How** is Steuben County responding to COVID?\n\n> “Our team of public health and emergency management officials utilize the Covid Act Now dashboards daily to gain additional operational awareness of virus transmission. The tool provides key metrics that help to educate our team and inform our decision making as we navigate this pandemic on the local level.”\n\nWheeler checks the Covid Act Now (CAN) website daily to create advisories about where county employees can safely travel.

New Orleans reached critical levels of COVID in late March and early April but has since stayed mostly below a high risk of outbreak. In her role as director of performance and accountability, Schigoda guides Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s COVID restrictions and local reopening plans by using and interpreting various COVID models to help inform policy decisions.\n\n## **What** is the challenge?\n\nSchigoda needs clear, authoritative, and accurate data to perform her work. She pays particularly close attention to the [infection growth rate](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#infection-growth-rate), or R(t), of COVID, because it shows how fast COVID is spreading. The R(t) informs how strict such COVID-related policies as reopening plans, mask mandates, and gathering size limitations need to be. To get a good idea of R(t), Schigoda must identify and analyze different COVID models and data platforms to interpret their various findings, draw conclusions about what local actions should be taken, and communicate this information to the mayor. Because there is no single standardized and universally accepted model, Schigoda and other decision makers struggle to understand which data is the most accurate for their region. Many of the major forecasting models in the COVID data landscape share common methodology, but they often have different assumptions, parameters, and technical approaches. Moreover, Schigoda has to grapple with understanding COVID on a local level while responding to state and federal regulations. Even when Louisiana’s state guidelines are unclear, leaders within the city of New Orleans have to respond appropriately to COVID and communicate a clear public health message to their constituents to encourage compliance. \n\n## **How** is Schigoda responding to COVID? \n\nSchigoda uses Covid Act Now (CAN) as a resource for clear, understandable COVID data. Schigoda is able to use the data to guide the mayor through the messy COVID data landscape and ensure that the mayor makes sound policy decisions regarding COVID restrictions and local reopening plans. [CAN’s county-level infection growth R(t) rate](https://covidactnow.org/us/la/county/orleans_parish/chart/0?s=1330330) has proven particularly useful for the mayor’s policy recommendations. For instance, Schigoda used CAN’s model to project the R(t) rate for the Fourth of July weekend to help the city better navigate the holiday. The results prompted the city to keep its phase two opening plan in place, including an enforced mask mandate and limits on gathering sizes and indoor capacities for restaurants and retail businesses. Schigoda then carefully analyzed the results of the holiday weekend to inform the city's next steps for reopening plans.\n\n> You have been hugely helpful. I love that you have taken what you originally had to these new metrics exactly as we needed them. And really appreciate the info design.

Serving nearly 40,000 county-elected officials and 3.6 million county employees, NACo helps make counties across America healthy, safe, and vibrant. \n\nTo achieve its mission, NACo engages with members, nurtures county leadership skills and knowledge networks, and supplies county officials with strong, evidence-based resources. Since the onset of COVID, NACo has deployed tools and resources to help county officials track their own local COVID situation and navigate reopening decisions.\n\n## **What** is the challenge?\n\nNACo’s mission is to strengthen America’s counties, but counties across the United States vary greatly in terms of size and resources; they range from New York City, home to 1.6 million Manhattanites, to rural counties in the West with fewer than a 1,000 residents. For this reason, when it comes to COVID reporting and data analysis, county officials have widely varying resources and needs, and NACo cannot offer one-size-fits-all solutions.\n\nIn order to support its broad range of members, NACo needs a diverse set of tools and resources to encourage data-backed decisions amidst COVID. To combat the pandemic, county officials have to make many important policy decisions, including guidance on mask-wearing, social gatherings, and local business openings, and how to allocate health resources. There is an overwhelming amount of publicly available data that is inconsistent and contradictory, making these decisions all the more difficult, particularly since every county has experienced COVID differently.\n\nNACo’s county resources and tools, then, need to be robust and evidence-based, but also relevant for hyper-local decision making.\n\n## **How** is NACo responding to COVID?\n\nCovid Act Now (CAN) was able to fill the need for a powerful, localized tool with its **[COVID Response Simulator (CRS)](https://covidactnow.org/tools#covid-response-simulator)**. \n\nThe CRS allows users to view the potential impact of [non-pharmaceutical interventions](/glossary#npi) (NPIs), such as mask-wearing and closing schools, on COVID statistics like case numbers and hospitalizations. It includes CAN’s powerful epidemiology model and data pulled directly from official state and county sources, but all of the inputs and assumptions are modifiable and can be changed to reflect local realities. County officials can use this tool to predict the effects of different policy interventions and make informed decisions on how to manage COVID for their county’s specific circumstances.\n\n![Image of Covid Act Now's Covid Response Simulator, showing the location inputs, model assumptions, and graphs](/images_cms/naco-screenshot.png \"COVID Response Simulator\")\n\n> All of the inputs and assumptions are modifiable and can be changed to reflect local realities\n\nNACo features CAN’s CRS through its twice-weekly COVID update e-blasts to 40,000 county officials, and it has invited CAN to join its “Reopening Town Hall.”",

Since the pandemic began, a new and important part of her job is advising her fellow employees and volunteers about COVID risks associated with traveling for work.\n\n## **What** is the challenge?\n\nGiven the high risk associated with COVID in senior populations, it is critical for Krieger to understand the danger her employees could put their patrons in based on their individual behaviors. \n\nKrieger has to assess and articulate the risks her employees could face when traveling to each state or county, and the dangers of returning to work after leaving a high-risk area.

          "body": "The [Civil Air Patrol (CAP)](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/) is a congressionally chartered, volunteer civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force. CAP is divided into 52 wings, or divisions of CAP members, which collectively cover all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington DC. CAP also has several overseas squadrons associated with military bases. CAP is a major resource to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Air Force, and state emergency services. The 60,000 members of CAP support communities with emergency services, such as search-and-rescue and disaster relief missions on the local and state level. It operates in the air and on the ground, and promotes aerospace and STEM careers to America’s youth through its aerospace education program and cadet program. \n\n> “Each of the wings is looking at CAN to get a sense if the metrics are trending up or down or are stable. It’s helped to guide us in the advice we give back to the different wings in moving toward opening up in different phases.” – Lt. Col. Stephen Leighton \n\nIn March, CAP created a COVID-19 planning team to guide, direct, and approve of phased remobilization plans across the U.S. The team is led by Brig. Gen. Edward D. Phelka, CAP’s National Vice Commander, and consists of Director of Operations Lt. Col. John W. Desmarais, Deputy Director of Operations Ron Olienyk, Senior Program Manager for Health Services Lt. Col. Thomas Janisko, Oregon Wing Inspector General Lt. Col. Edward Bos, and Deputy Senior Program Manager for Health Services Lt. Col. Stephen Leighton.\n\n![Civil Air Patrol COVID-19 planning team headshots](/images_cms/civil-air-patrol-leaders.png \"Civil Air Patrol COVID-19 planning team\")\n\n## **What** is the challenge?\n\nCOVID has affected many of CAP’s day-to-day and operational decisions, such as how to plan for non-COVID disaster relief, whether or not to resume flying, and how to safely run its usual cadet gatherings and youth programs. To advise the CAP wings, regional commanders, and local planning teams on these decisions, the COVID-19 response team must assess current and anticipated COVID risk at both the state and county level. For instance, where is it safest to hold meetings or training events? Where should CAP members be stationed to be ready for inbound hurricane season, while minimizing COVID exposure and spread due to major response needs? CAP’s team needs a reliable and easy-to-use data source that maps COVID risk on the state and county level and also includes some U.S. territories, as CAP regularly supports operations in Puerto Rico.\n\n> “CAP is following a phased approach to remobilizing our wings back to full operations.  CAN has allowed our COVID-19 Planning Team and our National Operations Center staff to provide timely information to our responding forces supporting emergency missions in response to events like hurricanes, flooding and fires. We still look at other sources, but CAN is normally our starting point.” – Lt. Col. John Desmarais\n\nBecause CAP can put people on the ground and execute missions at a much lower cost than the Air Force, it is responsible for about 90 percent to 95 percent of U.S.-based search-and-rescue and disaster relief missions for the Air Force. To execute its missions safely during the pandemic, it is critical that CAP understand COVID risk.\n\n## **How** is Civil Air Patrol responding to COVID?\n\nCivil Air Patrol’s COVID-19 planning team uses the [risk assessment map](https://covidactnow.org/?s=1330330) of Covid Act Now (CAN) to inform the approval or denial of phased remobilization plans proposed by each wing. This involves deciding whether or not to resume duties, operations, and programming, and determining the timeline for each wing’s mobilization based on the COVID risk in its respective states. When planning flights, cadet gatherings, and youth programs, CAP avoids counties or even entire states that are currently at or seem to be headed towards high COVID risk levels. State data is key to whether CAP approves the plans of its wings,  while county-level data may be used by individual wings in larger states with higher variance in COVID risk level, such as in California or Texas. In order to anticipate where future hotspots will be, the team focuses primarily on the directionality of the data trendlines, to see whether a state is trending up or down in daily new cases.\n\nIn addition, CAP must move forward with disaster relief plans regardless of COVID risk. But when making these plans, especially during hurricane season, CAP leverages county-level COVID data to help understand the intersection of non-COVID disasters with COVID risk and to make geographical planning, such as for evacuation. For example, while one county may be the most convenient to evacuate to geographically, the staff in the National Operations Center may advise a wing to evacuate to a neighboring county with a lower COVID risk level in order to best protect its responding personnel. Notably, despite the pandemic, 2020 has been one of CAP’s most successful years for search-and-rescue missions, with 130 lives saved nationally. CAP commanders and key staff attribute some of this success to using CAN data to make timely decisions and communicate easy-to-understand guidance. The CAP COVID-19 planning team continues to check CAN’s site daily for infection rate and daily new cases, and uses these visualizations as a resource to inform skeptical colleagues.\n\n> “If a hurricane hits South Carolina, we can give members more specific data on the safest place to stage disaster relief crews and aircraft. We can avoid placing our members in hotspots by using county-level information provided by CAN and other sources.” – Brig. Gen. [Edward D. Phelka](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/about/governance/cap-leadership/brig-gen-edward-phelka): National Vice Commander",

Tango is responsible for COVID response in her practice and making sure that her team has the necessary supplies and equipment to care for sick patients.\n\nTango owns and operates an operations consulting business, Whiskey Tango Operations Consulting, which helps provide advice on pandemic preparedness and response, and she is a Sergeant in the Florida National Guard.\n\n## **What** is the challenge?\n\nBecause she operates a private care practice, Tango needs to stay up-to-date on COVID and share clear and meaningful information with her patients, medical care colleagues, and consulting clients. She also needs a way to predict how the situation may change so that she can project how many tests, treatments, and eventually vaccines to order. It is paramount for Tango's practice to be able to project these numbers so that her team is prepared in the face of potential outbreaks.

For instance, she compares current [ICU capacity](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#icu-headroom) to what the anticipated capacities were, helping her better predict how ICU capacity will evolve in the future. CAN’s county-level data is especially useful in providing her with a clear picture of what is happening in her area specifically (versus the whole state). This allows her to take an individualized and tailored approach to developing pandemic response measures in her community. She trusts CAN over other sources because it provides her with the most accurate picture of COVID data and is a transparent, nonpartisan organization.\n\n> “I think what Covid Act Now really serves as is a model for communities to use \\[...]  to get an untainted data set, and less skewed for, you know, either political or personal interest or even just data mistakes.”\n\nCAN’s [Covid Response Simulator SEIR modeling tool](https://covidactnow.org/tools#covid-response-simulator) helps Arielle predict how COVID will progress in the future, allowing her to plan operating decisions like supply ordering, staffing in her practice, and more.

First organized in 1855, today the Washington National Guard is made up of more than 8,000 citizen soldiers and airmen who are dedicated to their mission of safeguarding the lives, property and the economy of Washington state. Guardsmen have deployed recently to Ukraine, Poland, Jordan and Iraq in support of contingency operations. Domestically, the Washington National Guard has responded to natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the Oso landslide, and it combats wildfires every year.\n\nSince March, the Washington National Guard has been supported by multiple state agencies including the Department of Health, the Department of Labor and Industries, and the Department of Agriculture.

Local-level Planning\n\n   COVID response in the United States has been a decentralized challenge with state and local governments, legislatures, and departments of health making key decisions. Many different agencies and jurisdictions were competing for limited resources. Across the country, many state governments turned to their National Guard to provide a single response force to meet these demands. In Washington, it was challenging to find authoritative, reliable, and trustworthy COVID data at a state level, and even more challenging to find granular, county level data. Smith needed both state and county-level COVID modeling backed by up-to-the-minute data in order to understand the current situation and communicate it to senior leaders.\n2. Scenario Planning \n\n   The Washington National Guard wanted to begin planning its COVID response more proactively. Senior leaders and planners within the COVID response needed to know what direction the local epidemic was headed in order to identify communities that might soon be in need. In order to meet this need, Smith needed to develop tools that could detect outbreaks as they occurred and forecast potential future needs. These tools needed to serve as an early warning system that could predict the level of COVID hospitalizations in Washington’s counties four to eight weeks out.\n3. Confidential Data with Limited Analytics\n\n   The Washington National Guard analyzes sensitive data about the current utilization of medical facilities and other COVID-related resources. This data comes directly from hospitals throughout Washington. The National Guard needed a solution that would enable it to analyze sanitized data on a separate, air-gapped server without compromising confidentiality and security of the original data system.\n\n## **How** is the Washington National Guard responding to COVID?\n\n[Washington](https://covidactnow.org/us/washington-wa?s=1364350) is home to the first documented COVID case in the United States, and Washington’s health care providers have been fighting COVID since February. By early March, Smith was actively looking for mathematically driven ways to predict the potential trajectory of COVID as part of his civilian employment in family medicine. There were few public health planning tools available that were robust enough for decision making. Existing tools were also not clear enough for use in communicating with civilians and policymakers with no health or epidemiological backgrounds. This led him to the original model published by Covid Act Now, which demonstrated the efficacy of a stay-at-home order, one of the most-discussed non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) at the time.\n\n![Screenshots of old Covid Act Now site showing risk map and Washington's projected outcomes with shelter in place](/images_cms/screenshots-covidactnow-archive.png \"Screenshots of Covid Act Now's site\")\n\n*The CovidActNow.org site as it appeared on 26MAR20. Courtesy of The Internet Archive Wayback Machine web.archive.org accessed on 7NOV20.*\n\nAfter looking into the background and experience of the team at Covid Act Now (CAN), Smith began visiting CAN’s [website](https://covidactnow.org/) on a near-daily basis. He liked the way that CAN distilled complicated COVID information into a handful of key metrics that were easy to communicate to others. The color scheme and flattened user interface was attractive to him. As an electronic medical record user, he appreciates that most information is available within one or two clicks. \n\nOnce he was activated by the Washington National Guard, Smith began to receive daily 30- to 40-page reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He found that he could still quickly get the same essential information in a few minutes from the CAN site. More important, he could still communicate that crucial information using the CAN interface. Smith and his team were able to identify where to deploy assets by knowing the infection growth rate, test positivity rate, and ICU headroom of counties across Washington. CAN’s COVID forecasts allow unit commanders three to five days of notice to optimize resource allocation, such as mobile testing sites and food bank support.\n\n![CDC report vs. Covid Act Now website](/images_cms/cdc-report-vs.-can-wa-national-guard.png \"CDC Report and CAN report \")\n\n*CDC Report vs. Covid Act Now site as of 7NOV20*\n\n> “You guys have done a great job of distilling down a lot of complicated information into just a few key metrics with nice color coding so that someone who’s involved in decision-making can look at it and be like, oh I get it.\"\n\nCAN's clear visuals and simple terminology allowed Smith to communicate effectively with policymakers and the public. The site was also designed for usability and built to load quickly, which helped Smith communicate with audiences over Zoom, where he would share his screen, and, with just one or two clicks, make his point about the appropriate course of action given the level of COVID in a particular region. \n\nEventually, Smith connected with the CAN team, including Dr. Nirav Shah, a senior scholar at Stanford University’s Clinical Excellence Research Center.\n\nBy June 2020, Smith had pivoted from public communication to tactical planning and he needed something more dynamic than the public-facing COVID model. He also needed a model that he could modify. With the major’s input, CAN’s team created the [Covid Response Simulator (CRS)](https://covidactnow.org/covid-response-simulator-redirect), a spreadsheet form of CAN’s epidemiological model, with modifiable inputs and assumptions that Smith could customize to reflect local realities. Using the CRS, Smith began simulating the impact that it would have on COVID to reopen schools, businesses and other organizations. He also simulated the impact of different levels of compliance with NPIs like mask mandates and stay-at-home orders.\n\n![covid response simulator screenshot](/images_cms/crs-screenshot.png \"CRS screenshot\")\n\nThe CRS helped and continues to help Smith derive more accurate and actionable insights. For instance, agriculture is an essential industry for [Yakima County](https://covidactnow.org/us/wa/county/yakima_county?s=1413385). Consequently, residents of this county would never be able to stay at home to the same extent as residents of other counties. As the local epidemic grew, modeling suggested that better adherence to a local mask order would slow the spread. Six weeks later, the infection rate declined and a crisis in the county’s hospitals was averted.\n\n> “In Whitman county, where Washington State University is located, we had an outbreak that evolved very rapidly. We were able to move mobile testing into Whitman county very quickly because we detected that outbreak as it happened instead of afterward. So where it might have taken a day or two to sort through disparate resources, instead it took just 15 minutes.”\n\nThe CRS allows the user to input either assumptions about local infection or actual observations as the pandemic wears on. This means that as new data sources are identified, they can be streamlined to fit the CRS, piped into the CRS backend, and used as a basis to simulate future needs in the community. Currently, Smith and his team enter official case counts and hospitalizations twice weekly in order to generate a projection for each county in the state of Washington. \n\nPrior to the CRS, the Washington National Guard had no reliable or scientifically driven method for estimating future disease growth in the state. Since June, Smith and his team have built a multi-layer database of code that is powered by a backend download of the CRS in order to automatically supply data on demand whenever a new model is needed. They have also built a front end to extract and analyze the data that the CRS produces based upon their user’s needs. To date, the team has published over 1,000 unique simulations using the CRS framework and generated over 100,000 data points for future analysis.\n\n![Washington National Guard analyzing COVID tests](/images_cms/wa-nat-guard-test-site.jpg \"Washington National Guard Covid Test\")\n\n*Image Credit: Maj.

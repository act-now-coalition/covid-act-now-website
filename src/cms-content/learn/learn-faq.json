          "question": "How is the coronavirus transmitted?\n",
          "answer": "Evidence suggests that COVID spreads mainly from person to person, primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when a person sneezes, coughs, or talks. These droplets are propelled through the air and can land in the noses and mouths of people, especially those in close proximity (six feet or less), according to the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html) (CDC) and [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-how-is-covid-19-transmitted?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqrb7BRDlARIsACwGad6u8LD7qnGFt5oFPYI4ngBzLUHYz2-9DZ_b4fruyio4ekVFoQR7l7YaAsm3EALw_wcB) (WHO). [Research](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857) supported by the CDC also suggests that COVID may spread through aerosol, or airborne, [transmission](/glossary#transmission). This is similar to transmission by droplets except that the amounts of fluid are much smaller and can linger in the air for a much longer time and [infect](/glossary#infection) people further than six feet away.",

          "question": "Which racial and ethnic minorities are at higher risk of contracting COVID and becoming seriously ill?",
          "answer": "Data from the CDC show that race and ethnicity, similar to age, are risk factors for COVID. The rates of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths among Blacks, Hispanic and Latino persons, and American Indians and Native Alaskans are much higher than for white people, according to the CDC’s calculation of [COVID-19 Hospitalization and Death by Race/Ethnicity](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html) (updated November 30, 2020). The [APM Research Lab](https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race) finds that death rates are more than three times higher for Black, Latino, and Indigenous people than for white people (updated November 12, 2020).\n\nA number of social factors contribute to COVID risk for racial and ethnic minorities. For example, many minorities have higher rates of poverty and less access to health care. This puts them at greater risk of underlying medical conditions that result in more severe COVID cases. Racial and ethnic minorities are also more likely to be essential workers, live in crowded multi-generational housing, and have less financial resources to take off work when sick or provide for necessities while sheltering in place. Discrimination, including racism, contributes to these long-term social deficits and more immediately to inadequate health care access, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html).",

The current understanding of reinfection is limited due to the novelty of the virus, but ongoing studies will provide more insight into how frequently reinfection occurs and how long immunity from COVID may last after your first infection. Even if you’ve already had COVID or have antibodies, the [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/reinfection.html#:~:text=Cases%20of%20reinfection%20with%20COVID,some%20reinfections%20are%20expected.) taking the same precautions against the virus, including [mask wearing](/glossary#face-mask) and [social distancing](/glossary#social-distancing)."

In Italy, which was one of the first countries to be hit hard by the disease, many survivors are still experiencing health problems after having COVID. In one [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351), more than 87 percent of individuals experienced one or more symptoms (most commonly fatigue and difficulty breathing) after recovery from COVID. Meanwhile, a German [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916) found that 78 of 100 recovered COVID patients continued to experience heart abnormalities months after [infection](/glossary#infection).",

          "question": "What is counted as a COVID death?",
          "answer": "The [WHO](https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf?ua=1) states that a COVID death can be “a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death.” (The CDC’s  offers further [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/coding-and-reporting.htm) on reporting and coding deaths due to COVID.)\n\nTracking the number of COVID deaths is difficult, and some suggest that the number is underreported. One issue is that individuals infected with the [virus](/glossary#virus) may be sick for many days, or even weeks, before death, so the increase in deaths resulting from a [wave](/glossary#wave) of [infections](/glossary#infection) may lag significantly in time. In some cases people may die indirectly from COVID, because hospitals were overcrowded with COVID patients and care was late or unavailable. To track the number of COVID deaths, researchers rely on something called “excess mortality” — the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis that are above the historical average during non-crisis times. For information on excess mortality, see the CDC’s report, [Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm).",

          "answer": "[R-nought (R0)](/glossary#r0) represents the natural ability of a virus to spread in an unprotected population where no special precautions are being taken. [R(t)](/glossary#rt), in contrast, takes into account public health measures or the development of a [vaccine](/glossary#vaccine). This makes R(t) —the actual or “effective” of the virus under current conditions —  a more accurate reflection of the number of people that a single infected person is expected to infect in a specific area at a specific time. It is also more relevant than R0 in directing public policy and informing private behavior. The value of R(t) can change over time, depending on such factors as how many people are staying home or wearing masks. At Covid Act Now, we look at R(t), because it represents more closely what is happening right now and is calculated based on actual death and hospitalization data.

          "question": "How can I use Covid Act Now to assess the COVID risk level in my community?",
          "answer": "Covid Act Now uses five metrics to explore how serious a threat the virus poses in a particular state or county at a given time:  [Daily New Cases](https://blog.covidactnow.org/daily-new-cases-explained/), [Infection Rate](https://blog.covidactnow.org/infection-rate-explained-2/), [Test Positivity](https://blog.covidactnow.org/test-positivity-explained/), [ICU Headroom](https://blog.covidactnow.org/icu-headroom-used-explained/), and [Contact Tracers Hired](https://blog.covidactnow.org/changes-to-how-we-assess-contact-tracing/). For definitions and assumptions about our metrics, [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cd_cEpNiIl1TzUJBvw9sHLbrbUZ2qCxgN32IqVLa3Do/edit). \n\n• **Daily New Cases** is a measure of new confirmed COVID cases per day. To ensure that incidence (which is what this metric measures) can be compared across jurisdictions, we calculate it as a proportion of the population — specifically, new daily cases per 100,000 people. We source our new positive cases from [The New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/covid).\n\n• **Infection rate** — [R(t)](/glossary#rt) — is the number of people one infected person goes on to infect in a specified area over a specific time period.\n\n• **Positive test rate** (also known as [test positivity rate](/glossary#test-positivity)) is based on inputs from [Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) for states and [Corona Data Scraper](https://coronadatascraper.com/#home) for counties, which give us the cumulative number of positive tests performed and the cumulative number of negative tests performed. We then subtract yesterday's totals from today's to find today's number of new total tests and new positive tests. For days in which the data is missing, we interpolate from neighboring values.\n\n• **ICU Headroom** measures whether hospitals can handle an increased load of new COVID cases without having to resort to [crisis standards of care](/glossary#crisis-standards-of-care). We scrape [data](/glossary#data) for the typical ICU bed capacity and typical ICU utilization from [Covid Care Map](https://github.com/covidcaremap/covid19-healthsystemcapacity#overview).\n\n• **Tracers Hired** measures whether a state has hired enough [contact tracers](/glossary#contact-tracing) to trace all cases. Unfortunately, many programs are not effective, even when they hire enough tracers. According to [Resolve to Save Lives](https://contacttracingplaybook.resolvetosavelives.org/checklists/metrics), the best metric to measure the outcomes of a tracing program is the “percent of new cases arising among contacts identified by the program and under [quarantine](/glossary#quarantine).” Covid Act Now would love to switch to this metric, but currently Washington D.C. and New Jersey are the only states/territories reporting this data. We derive our contact tracing data from [Test and Trace](https://testandtrace.com/), an organization that tracks the total number of contact tracers and the number of tracers per daily positive test in an area. For more information about contact tracing, read the blog post [here](https://blog.covidactnow.org/changes-to-how-we-assess-contact-tracing/).

          "answer": "Yes! [Masks](/glossary#face-mask) that cover your nose and mouth are extremely helpful in reducing the spread of COVID. They help to protect you and those around you, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks). The virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even if no one is exhibiting any [symptoms](/glossary#asymptomatic), and wearing a mask gives you an added layer of protection. If there were a medication that dramatically reduced your chances of giving or getting COVID, would you take that medication? In practical terms, a mask is such a medication.",

          "answer": "Wearing a [mask](/glossary#face-mask) is extremely important to help contain COVID and decreases the risks for both you and those around you. However, not all masks are created equal. [Experts](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/health/cdc-face-mask-guidelines-wellness/index.html) recommend wearing two- or three-ply masks made with a tight weave of 100 percent cotton. Disposable and silk masks are also effective at repelling droplets. When looking for a mask, fit is incredibly important. Your mask should fit snugly over the bridge of your nose and below your chin. Studies have shown that loose-fitting masks, such as bandanas and gaiters, are the least effective. While N95 masks are the most effective at filtering out particles, they are still considered critical supplies and should be reserved for health care workers and first responders."

          "question": "How do I discuss the pandemic with friends or family members who aren’t taking it seriously?",
          "answer": "It can be challenging to discuss the pandemic with people who think it’s overblown and aren’t taking precautions. You may be tempted to immediately begin reciting the facts and what the data is showing, but sometimes this can put people off. Instead, it’s important to consider how you are presenting those facts. [Research](https://www.mikeyeomans.info/papers/receptiveness.pdf) finds that conversations are more productive when you avoid condescending tones and let the other person know that you are listening. Try these approaches:\n\n* Actively solicit their perspective on the issue, and show that you are listening (e.g., say “I hear you” or “I see what you mean”). When you understand the beliefs of your friends or family members, you can tailor how you communicate with them in a way that resonates with them instead of turning them off. \n* Avoid allowing your emotions to get the best of you. Stay calm and objective, using a friendly tone to share your thoughts. A collected and approachable tone improves the chances of your counterpart listening to the facts and learning from you.",

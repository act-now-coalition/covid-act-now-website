          "question": "How is the coronavirus transmitted?\n",
          "answer": "Evidence suggests that COVID spreads mainly from person to person, primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when a person sneezes, coughs, or talks. These droplets are propelled through the air and can land in the noses and mouths of people, especially those in close proximity (six feet or less), according to the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html) (CDC) and [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-how-is-covid-19-transmitted?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqrb7BRDlARIsACwGad6u8LD7qnGFt5oFPYI4ngBzLUHYz2-9DZ_b4fruyio4ekVFoQR7l7YaAsm3EALw_wcB) (WHO). [Research](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857) supported by the CDC also suggests that COVID may spread through aerosol, or airborne, transmission. This is similar to transmission by droplets except that the amounts of fluid are much smaller and can linger in the air for a much longer time and infect people further than six feet away."

          "question": "How long does the virus live on surfaces?",
          "answer": "The virus can live from several hours to several days on surfaces, depending on the type of material (cardboard, plastic, etc.). Even so, the CDC says that COVID is not transmitted easily through surfaces and spreads mainly from person-to-person. If you are concerned about surface contamination, you can find details on appropriate cleaning and sanitizing protocols from the CDC [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/pdf/Reopening_America_Guidance.pdf#:~:text=Coronaviruses%20on%20surfaces%20and%20objects,and%20dirt%20from%20surfaces.)."

        {
          "question": "Which individuals are most vulnerable to COVID?",
          "answer": "Anyone who has been exposed to COVID is at risk of contracting the disease, and people of all ages have experienced hospitalization and death. Some people, however, are at greater risk. Elderly individuals, particularly those 85 or older, and people with certain underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness, according to the CDC. (Click [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-increased-risk.html) for information from the CDC about people at increased risk.)"
        },
        {
          "question": "Which demographic groups are most likely to become infected with COVID, to become seriously ill, or to die from the virus?",
          "answer": "Data from the CDC show that race and ethnicity, similar to age, are risk factors for COVID. In fact, the rates of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths among Blacks, Hispanic and Latino persons, and American Indians and Native Alaskans are much higher than for white people, according to the agency’s calculation of [COVID-19 Hospitalization and Death by Race/Ethnicity](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html) (updated August 18, 2020). Some data show an even higher mortality rate among certain ethnic and racial groups than the CDC data. The [APM Research Lab](https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race) finds that death rates are more than three times higher for Blacks, Latinos, and Indigenous people than for white people (update September 15)."

        {
          "question": "What are the long-term effects of COVID?",
          "answer": "While some people recover quickly from COVID, others suffer debilitating, long-term symptoms, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351). In Italy, which was one of the first countries to be hit hard by the disease, many survivors are still experiencing health problems after having COVID. In one [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351), more than 87 percent of individuals experienced one or more symptoms (most commonly fatigue and difficulty breathing) after recovery from COVID. Meanwhile, a German [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916) found that 78 of 100 recovered COVID patients continued to experience heart abnormalities months after infection."
        },
        {
          "question": "When is an infected person considered recovered?",
          "answer": "According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html), a person with COVID who has been isolating at home may discontinue isolation when (1) at least 10 days have passed since symptom onset; (2) at least 24 hours have passed fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications; and (3) other symptoms have improved. Those “who never develop symptoms may discontinue isolation and other precautions 10 days after the date of their first positive” PCR test for COVID-19."
        },
        {
          "question": "How common are asymptomatic cases?",
          "answer": "Many individuals infected with COVID are asymptomatic (that is, they do not manifest symptoms of the virus), which makes COVID much harder to control. When people do not know that they are ill, they do not take precautions. In much the same way, people who are “pre-symptomatic” – that is, they will eventually develop symptoms ‒ may unknowingly spread the disease to others before they realize that they are ill. The [CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html) that 40 percent of COVID cases are asymptomatic (Scenario 5, updated as of July 10, 2020, gives the CDC’s “Current Best Estimate” and cites the relevant literature)."

        {
          "question": "What is counted as a COVID death?",
          "answer": "The [WHO](https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf?ua=1) states that a COVID death can be “a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death.” (You can find the CDC’s guidance on reporting and coding deaths due to COVID [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/coding-and-reporting.htm).)\n\nTracking the number of COVID deaths is difficult, and some suggest that the number is underreported. One issue is that individuals infected with the virus may be sick for many days, or even weeks, before death, so the increase in deaths resulting from a wave of infections may lag significantly in time. In some cases people may die indirectly from COVID, because hospitals were overcrowded with COVID patients and care was late or unavailable. To track the number of COVID deaths, researchers rely on something called “excess mortality” — the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis that are above the historical average during non-crisis times. For information on excess mortality, see the CDC’s report, [Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm)."

          "question": "How is the coronavirus transmitted?\n",
          "answer": "Evidence suggests that COVID spreads mainly from person to person, primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when a person sneezes, coughs, or talks. These droplets are propelled through the air and can land in the noses and mouths of people, especially those in close proximity (six feet or less), according to the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html) (CDC) and [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-how-is-covid-19-transmitted?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqrb7BRDlARIsACwGad6u8LD7qnGFt5oFPYI4ngBzLUHYz2-9DZ_b4fruyio4ekVFoQR7l7YaAsm3EALw_wcB) (WHO). [Research](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857) supported by the CDC also suggests that COVID may spread through aerosol, or airborne, transmission. This is similar to transmission by droplets except that the amounts of fluid are much smaller and can linger in the air for a much longer time and infect people further than six feet away."

        {
          "question": "How long does the virus live on surfaces?",
          "answer": "The virus can live from several hours to several days on surfaces, depending on the type of material (cardboard, plastic, etc.). Even so, the CDC says that COVID is not transmitted easily through surfaces and spreads mainly from person-to-person. If you are concerned about surface contamination, you can find details on appropriate cleaning and sanitizing protocols from the CDC [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/pdf/Reopening_America_Guidance.pdf#:~:text=Coronaviruses%20on%20surfaces%20and%20objects,and%20dirt%20from%20surfaces.)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Who is most at risk of getting COVID?",
          "answer": "Anyone who has been exposed to COVID is at risk of contracting the disease, and people of all ages have experienced hospitalization and death. Some people, however, are at greater risk. Elderly individuals, particularly those 85 or older, and people with certain underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness, according to the CDC. (Click [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-increased-risk.html) for information from the CDC about people at increased risk.)"
        },
        {
          "question": "Which demographic groups are most likely to become infected with COVID, to become seriously ill, or to die from the virus?",
          "answer": "Data from the CDC show that race and ethnicity, similar to age, are risk factors for COVID. In fact, the rates of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths among Blacks, Hispanic and Latino persons, and American Indians and Native Alaskans are much higher than for white people, according to the CDC’s calculation of [COVID-19 Hospitalization and Death by Race/Ethnicity](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html) (updated August 18, 2020). Some data show an even higher mortality rate among certain ethnic and racial groups than the CDC data. The [APM Research Lab](https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race) finds that COVID death rates are more than three times higher for Blacks, Latinos, and Indigenous people than for white people (update September 15)."

      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What are the long-term effects of COVID?",
          "answer": "While some people recover quickly from COVID, others suffer debilitating, long-term symptoms, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351). In Italy, which was one of the first countries to be hit hard by the disease, many survivors are still experiencing health problems after having COVID. In one [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351), more than 87 percent of individuals experienced one or more symptoms (most commonly fatigue and difficulty breathing) after recovery from COVID. Meanwhile, a German [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916) found that 78 of 100 recovered COVID patients continued to experience heart abnormalities months after infection."
        },
        {
          "question": "When is an infected person considered recovered?",
          "answer": "According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html), a person with COVID who has been isolating at home may stop isolating when (1) at least 10 days have passed since symptom onset; (2) at least 24 hours have passed fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications; and (3) other symptoms have improved. Those “who never develop symptoms may discontinue isolation and other precautions 10 days after the date of their first positive” PCR test for COVID."
        },
        {
          "question": "How common are asymptomatic cases?",
          "answer": "Many individuals infected with COVID are asymptomatic (that is, they do not have symptoms of the virus). When people do not know that they are ill, they do not take precautions. In much the same way, people who are “pre-symptomatic” – that is, they will eventually develop symptoms ‒ may unknowingly spread the disease to others before they realize that they are ill. The [CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html) that 40 percent of COVID cases are asymptomatic."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is counted as a COVID death?",
          "answer": "The [WHO](https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf?ua=1) states that a COVID death can be “a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death.” (You can find the CDC’s guidance on reporting and coding deaths due to COVID [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/coding-and-reporting.htm).)\n\nTracking the number of COVID deaths is difficult, and some suggest that the number is underreported. One issue is that individuals infected with the virus may be sick for many days, or even weeks, before death, so the increase in deaths resulting from a wave of infections may lag significantly in time. In some cases people may die indirectly from COVID, because hospitals were overcrowded with COVID patients and care was late or unavailable. To track the number of COVID deaths, researchers rely on something called “excess mortality” — the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis that are above the historical average during non-crisis times. For information on excess mortality, see the CDC’s report, [Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm)."

      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "Why is testing important?",
          "answer": "Diagnostic testing allows health officials to identify and isolate infected individuals and begin contact tracing to quarantine people who were exposed. It also allows public health officials to collect the data and information necessary to know when it is safe to resume ordinary activities or when non-pharmaceutical interventions like masks are critical. Leaders of the [American Heart Association](https://healthmetrics.heart.org/covid-19-science-why-testing-is-so-important/), the [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/why-cdc-was-right-revise-coronavirus-testing-guidelines) and the [National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/why-covid-19-testing-key-getting-back-normal), among other organizations, have all urged for an expansion of testing."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is a low positive test rate a good sign?\n",
          "answer": "Many people infected with COVID are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, making it difficult to know how widespread the disease is in a community. If there is ample testing being done, including of individuals who have no reason to believe that they have the virus, then many negative test results will be received, leading to a low test positivity rate. This is an indication that adequate testing is being done in an area and that there are not a lot of undetected cases in the community. (See our [blog](https://blog.covidactnow.org/test-positivity-explained/) for more information on test positivity rates)."
        },
        {
          "question": "When tests are conducted, where do the results get counted?",
          "answer": "State reporting practices differ. In most states, the test results are reported where individuals are tested, not where they live. Florida, however, distinguishes between residents and non-residents in the statistics it publishes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does CAN's positive test rate metric show PCR or PCR and Serology test results?\n",
          "answer": "We get our state testing data from [The Covid Tracking Project,](https://covidtracking.com/) which aggregates the data from the states’ dashboards. No state should mix the results of diagnostic tests (including PCR tests and antigen tests) with the results of antibody tests. Serology tests looking for COVID antibodies can identify individuals who have had the virus at some point in the past, but they should not be used to diagnose an active COVID infection, according to the Food and Drug Administration’s [Coronavirus Testing Basics](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics). Some states, at various times, have included both diagnostic and antibody tests in their reports. We make every possible effort to obtain data that is not corrupted, but ultimately we must work with the data that is available."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is pool testing?",
          "answer": "Pooled testing is a process in which samples — such as PCR nasal swabs — are collected and tested in a batch, or pool, rather than individually. If the pool comes back positive, one or more of the people in the pool may be infected, and each sample must be tested again individually. The hope is that by pooling samples, there will be fewer overall tests, saving testing supplies and allowing more tests to be run at a time, according to the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-first-emergency-authorization-sample-pooling-diagnostic), which approved pooled testing for Quest Diagnostics in July."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is R-nought (R0) and how is it different from R(t)?",
          "answer": "R-nought (R0) represents the natural ability of a virus to spread in an unprotected population where no special precautions are being taken. R(t), in contrast, takes into account public health measures or the development of a vaccine. This makes R(t) —the actual or “effective” spread of the virus under current conditions —  a more accurate reflection of the number of people that a single infected person is expected to infect in a specific area at a specific time. It is also more relevant than R0 in directing public policy and informing private behavior. The value of R(t) can change over time, depending on such factors as how many people are staying home or wearing masks. At Covid Act Now, we look at R(t), because it represents more closely what is happening right now and is calculated based on actual death and hospitalization data. You can read about where our data comes from in this [blog post](https://blog.covidactnow.org/where-does-our-data-come-from/) and in our [Assumptions and References document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cd_cEpNiIl1TzUJBvw9sHLbrbUZ2qCxgN32IqVLa3Do/edit).

        {
          "question": "What is contact tracing?",
          "answer": "Contact tracing is an effective strategy for slowing the spread of COVID. It involves finding out who has been in close contact with an individual infected with COVID, letting those people know that they may have been exposed, and guiding them on what they should do next. The work of contact tracers can be extremely labor-intensive and difficult, given that many contacts are difficult to identify and locate. After informing people that they are at risk for the infection, contact tracers provide advice on quarantine procedures and testing.

        {
          "question": "How can Covid Act Now help me assess how well the spread of\nCOVID is being controlled in my community?\n",
          "answer": "We have developed an approach that uses five metrics to explore how serious a threat the virus poses in a particular state or county at a given time:  [Daily New Cases](https://blog.covidactnow.org/daily-new-cases-explained/), [Infection Rate](https://blog.covidactnow.org/infection-rate-explained-2/), [Test Positivity](https://blog.covidactnow.org/test-positivity-explained/), [ICU Headroom](https://blog.covidactnow.org/icu-headroom-used-explained/), and [Contact Tracers Hired](https://blog.covidactnow.org/changes-to-how-we-assess-contact-tracing/). For definitions and assumptions about our metrics, [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cd_cEpNiIl1TzUJBvw9sHLbrbUZ2qCxgN32IqVLa3Do/edit). \n\n• **Daily New Cases** is a measure of new confirmed COVID cases per day. To ensure that incidence (which is what this metric measures) can be compared across jurisdictions, we calculate it as a proportion of the population — specifically, new daily cases per 100,000 people. We source our new positive cases from [The New York Tim](https://developer.nytimes.com/covid)es. For more information about this metric, read our blog posts [here](https://blog.covidactnow.org/new-daily-covid-cases/) and [here](https://blog.covidactnow.org/what-is-covid-incidence/).\n\n• **Infection rate** — R(t) — is the number of people one infected person goes on to infect in a specified area over a specific time period. For more information about how R(t) is calculated, read our blog post [here](https://blog.covidactnow.org/infection-rate-explained-2/) and [here](https://blog.covidactnow.org/covid-infection-rate/).\n\n• **Positive test rate** (also known as test positivity rate) is based on inputs from [Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) for states and [Corona Data S](https://coronadatascraper.com/#home)craper for counties, which give us the cumulative number of positive tests performed and the cumulative number of negative tests performed. We then subtract yesterday's totals from today's to find today's number of new total tests and new positive tests. For days in which the data is missing, we interpolate from neighboring values.\n\n• **ICU Headroom** measures whether hospitals can handle an increased load of new COVID cases without having to resort to crisis standards of care. We scrape data for the typical ICU bed capacity and typical ICU utilization from [Covid Ca](https://github.com/covidcaremap/covid19-healthsystemcapacity#overview)re Map.\n\n• **Tracers Hired** measures whether a state has hired enough contact tracers to trace all cases. Unfortunately, many programs are not effective, even when they hire enough tracers. According to [Resolve to Save Lives](https://contacttracingplaybook.resolvetosavelives.org/checklists/metrics), the best metric to measure the outcomes of a tracing program is the “percent of new cases arising among contacts identified by the program and under quarantine.” We would love to switch to this metric, but currently Washington D.C. and New Jersey are the only states/territories reporting this data. We derive our contact tracing data from [Test and Trace](https://testandtrace.com/), an organization that tracks the total number of contact tracers and the number of tracers per daily positive test in an area. For more information about contact tracing, read our blog post [here](https://blog.covidactnow.org/changes-to-how-we-assess-contact-tracing/). For more on data sources, see our [data sources deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XmKCBWYZr9VQKFAdWh_Dhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XmKCBWYZr9VQKFAdWh_D7pkpGGM_oR9cPjj-UrNdMJQ/edit#slide=id.g91040bbb51_413_0).

          "question": "Is it safe to reopen?",
          "answer": "At [Covid Act Now](https://covidactnow.org/?s=756131), we determine a COVID risk level (active or imminent outbreak; at risk of outbreak; slow disease growth; or on track to contain COVID) for each state and county, based on five metrics. Our mission is to provide data and disease intelligence to help public officials and the general public make informed decisions. Counties designated as “on track” can open more safely than those in higher risk groups. Of course, no community is entirely safe from COVID until we have an effective vaccine that has been widely adopted."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it safe to reopen schools?",
          "answer": "There are many ways that schools can reduce risk. For instance, schools may adopt plans to limit infections, such as establishing effective protocols for testing, tracking and tracing, and providing masks and other protective equipment. Still, some schools may face limitations. They may have a greater density of students and employees in buildings, poorer ventilation and less opportunity for outdoor learning. We suggest that decision makers use the data available on [our site](https://covidactnow.org/?s=785141) to assess risk and consider the ability of the school and school district to keep students and teachers safe."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I travel safely?",
          "answer": "For the time being, it is safest not to travel. In particular, travel by plane, which may require you to sit close to others for hours, and by cruise ship are particularly risky, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html). If you must travel, look at the data on [our site](https://covidactnow.org/?s=768133) to compare the state and county risk levels where you will be. If you plan to fly, take time to research and assess the measures different airlines are taking to reduce risky behaviors and comply with local laws to contain the spread of COVID."

          "question": "Are masks helpful in reducing the spread of coronavirus?\n",
          "answer": "Yes! Masks are extremely helpful in reducing the spread of coronavirus. They help to protect you and those around you. We recommend that you wear a mask covering your mouth and nose. This recommendation follows advice from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks), and there is a body of research, including from the [National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857), that suggests everyone should wear a mask. We know that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even if no one is exhibiting any symptoms, and wearing a mask gives you an added layer of protection. If there were a medication that dramatically reduced your chances of giving or getting COVID, would you take that medication? In practical terms, a mask is such a medication."

          "question": "How do I discuss the pandemic with friends or family members who aren’t taking it seriously?",
          "answer": "It can be challenging to discuss the pandemic with people who think it’s overblown and aren’t taking precautions. You may be tempted to immediately begin reciting the facts and what the data is showing, but sometimes this can put people off. Instead, it’s important to consider how you are presenting those facts. [Research](https://www.mikeyeomans.info/papers/receptiveness.pdf) finds that conversations are more productive when you avoid condescending tones and let the other person know that you are listening. Try these approaches:\n\n* Actively solicit their perspective on the issue, and show that you are listening (e.g., say “I hear you” or “I see what you mean”). When you understand the beliefs of your friends or family members, you can tailor how you communicate with them in a way that resonates with them instead of turning them off. \n* Avoid allowing your emotions to get the best of you. Stay calm and objective, using a friendly tone to share your thoughts. A collected and approachable tone improves the chances of your counterpart listening to the facts and learning from you."

The ACIP determined that health care workers and staff and residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities should be vaccinated first. But each state has adopted its own priorities for who to include in subsequent vaccination groups. Learn more through this analysis by the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-covid-19-vaccine-priority-line-continues-to-change-as-states-make-further-updates/).\n\nAs the vaccine supply increases, more groups will be added, with the goal of there being enough vaccines for everyone in the U.S. who wants one to be able to get one easily, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html)."

          "answer": "Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a COVID vaccine must be free of charge to anyone who wants it. The federal government has purchased millions of vaccine shots and distributed them to providers. While providers may charge a fee for administering the vaccine, both private insurance and public programs must cover 100 percent of the fee, according to the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/vaccine-coverage-pricing-and-reimbursement-in-the-u-s/). Uninsured patients also face no charges, as providers are reimbursed for administrative costs by the [Provider Relief Fund](https://www.hrsa.gov/coronavirus), which was established under the CARES Act."

          "answer": "Approved COVID vaccines were developed in record time, but this does not mean that any safety protocols were bypassed. All vaccines have gone through rigorous testing to ensure their safety. Each vaccine must undergo clinical trials, with study participants followed for two months after completing a vaccination series to prove that the vaccine is safe and effective, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked). After the Food and Drug Administration determines that a vaccine is safe, the Advisory Committee on Immunization carefully reviews all available data before making its recommendation to the CDC.\n\nEven after a vaccine is in use, the CDC continues to monitor its safety. Health care providers, for instance, are required to report adverse vaccine reactions to a [national warning system](https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html). Fortunately, of the first 1.9 million people to receive shots of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID vaccine, only 0.2% [experienced an adverse event](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm), such as fatique or headache, and very few reactions were serious.\n\nLearn more about [how federal partners are ensuring the safety of COVID vaccines in the United States.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html)"

While side effects may get in the way of your daily activities, they typically go away in a few days. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html), side effects may include: \n\n* **Pain and swelling on your arm** **where you received the shot**. This can be alleviated by applying a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area, or by using or exercising your arm. \n* **Fever, chills, tiredness, and headache**. To reduce discomfort from fever, drink plenty of fluids and dress lightly. You may also want to talk to your doctor about taking an over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. \n\nYou may want to contact your doctor or healthcare provider if: \n\n* The area around your shot becomes more red and tender after 24 hours.\n* Your side effects last longer than a few days or you feel concerned."

Some [studies](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/13/1005103/immunity-to-covid-19-could-disappear-in-months-a-new-study-suggests/) have found that immunity goes away quickly, but more recent [studies](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/06/1015822/covid-19-immunity-likely-lasts-for-years/) have found that your body has robust immunity for many months. \n\nThe upshot: With any new disease, we don’t know how long infection-acquired immunity might last—or how much it might vary from person to person, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html). This is also true for COVID vaccines.

It thus needs to be collected manually. What’s more, eligibility varies not only from state to state, but also sometimes by county, and even by city. Finally, vaccine eligibility information may change as states, counties, or cities adjust their roll-out plans, and making sure this information is up to date is a manual process of regularly checking government websites. For all those reasons, we currently have a limited number of locations that we are able to support with vaccine eligibility alerts."

          "answer": "Evidence suggests that COVID spreads mainly from person to person, primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when a person sneezes, coughs, or talks. These droplets are propelled through the air and can land in the noses and mouths of people, especially those in close proximity (six feet or less), according to the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html) (CDC) and [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-how-is-covid-19-transmitted?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqrb7BRDlARIsACwGad6u8LD7qnGFt5oFPYI4ngBzLUHYz2-9DZ_b4fruyio4ekVFoQR7l7YaAsm3EALw_wcB) (WHO). [Research](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857) supported by the CDC also suggests that COVID may spread through aerosol, or airborne, [transmission](/glossary#transmission).

The rates of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths among Blacks, Hispanic and Latino persons, and American Indians and Native Alaskans are much higher than for white people, according to the CDC’s calculation of [COVID-19 Hospitalization and Death by Race/Ethnicity](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html) (updated November 30, 2020). The [APM Research Lab](https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race) finds that death rates are more than three times higher for Black, Latino, and Indigenous people than for white people (updated November 12, 2020).\n\nA number of social factors contribute to COVID risk for racial and ethnic minorities. For example, many minorities have higher rates of poverty and less access to health care. This puts them at greater risk of underlying medical conditions that result in more severe COVID cases. Racial and ethnic minorities are also more likely to be essential workers, live in crowded multi-generational housing, and have less financial resources to take off work when sick or provide for necessities while sheltering in place. Discrimination, including racism, contributes to these long-term social deficits and more immediately to inadequate health care access, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html).",

There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death.” (The CDC’s  offers further [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/coding-and-reporting.htm) on reporting and coding deaths due to COVID.)\n\nTracking the number of COVID deaths is difficult, and some suggest that the number is underreported. One issue is that individuals infected with the [virus](/glossary#virus) may be sick for many days, or even weeks, before death, so the increase in deaths resulting from a [wave](/glossary#wave) of [infections](/glossary#infection) may lag significantly in time. In some cases people may die indirectly from COVID, because hospitals were overcrowded with COVID patients and care was late or unavailable. To track the number of COVID deaths, researchers rely on something called “excess mortality” — the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis that are above the historical average during non-crisis times.

In particular, travel by plane, which may require you to sit close to others for hours, and by cruise ship are particularly risky, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html). If you must travel, look at the data on [our site](https://covidactnow.org/?s=768133) to compare the state and county risk levels where you will be. If you plan to fly, take time to research and assess the measures different airlines are taking to reduce risky behaviors and comply with local laws to contain the spread of COVID. The CDC also strongly recommends wearing a face mask and offers [guidance]([what-masks-most-effective]) on choosing the best type.",

          "answer": "It’s important to get tested for COVID after any potential [exposure](/glossary#exposed) to the [virus](/glossary#virus), whether that’s through contact with a [confirmed case](/glossary#confirmed-case) or traveling in close company with strangers. Since COVID has a long [incubation period](/glossary#incubation-period), it may take a few days before [PCR tests](/glossary#pcr-test) detect a sufficient enough amount of the virus to report a positive result, leading to high rates of [false-negatives](/glossary#false-negative) during the first few days after exposure. While it’s always recommended to [quarantine](/glossary#quarantine) for 14 days, [experts recommend](https://medical.mit.edu/covid-19-updates/2020/07/when-should-i-be-tested) being tested five to seven days after a probable exposure for the most accurate test results.",

Both tests are performed by collecting nasal or throat swabs, but antigen tests report results in minutes while PCR tests can take up to a week to return results depending on lab capacity. While rapid tests are more convenient and often cheaper, they report significantly higher rates of [false negatives](\\[/glossary#false-negative]) of [up to 50 percent](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-test-is-best-for-covid-19-2020081020734).

The virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even if no one is exhibiting any [symptoms](/glossary#asymptomatic), and wearing a mask gives you an added layer of protection.

          "answer": "Wearing a [mask](/glossary#face-mask) is extremely important to help contain COVID and decreases the risks for both you and those around you. However, not all masks are created equal. [Experts](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/health/cdc-face-mask-guidelines-wellness/index.html) recommend wearing two- or three-ply masks made with a tight weave of 100 percent cotton. Disposable and silk masks are also effective at repelling droplets. More people are wearing two layers of face masks, which some experts say makes common sense. Most important, however, is making sure your mask fits snugly over the bridge of your nose and below your chin. Studies have shown that loose-fitting masks, such as bandanas and gaiters, are the least effective. While N95 masks are the most effective at filtering out particles, they are still considered critical supplies and should be reserved for health care workers and first responders."

          "question": "How do I discuss the pandemic with friends or family members who aren’t taking it seriously?",
          "answer": "It can be challenging to discuss the pandemic with people who think it’s overblown and aren’t taking precautions. You may be tempted to immediately begin reciting the facts and what the data is showing, but sometimes this can put people off. Instead, it’s important to consider how you are presenting those facts. [Research](https://www.mikeyeomans.info/papers/receptiveness.pdf) finds that conversations are more productive when you avoid condescending tones and let the other person know that you are listening. Try these approaches:\n\n* Actively solicit their perspective on the issue, and show that you are listening (e.g., say “I hear you” or “I see what you mean”). When you understand the beliefs of your friends or family members, you can tailor how you communicate with them in a way that resonates with them instead of turning them off. \n* Avoid allowing your emotions to get the best of you. Stay calm and objective, using a friendly tone to share your thoughts. A collected and approachable tone improves the chances of your counterpart listening to the facts and learning from you.",

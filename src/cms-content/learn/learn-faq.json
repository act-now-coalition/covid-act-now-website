          "answer": "When you or someone you care about becomes eligible, you can schedule an appointment online or over the phone. There are two primary ways you can find a vaccine appointment:\n\n1. [Vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/) is a federally supported website managed in partnership with the CDC. It allows individuals to see where vaccines are in stock near their selected zip code, and it provides the phone number, website link, and directions to these sites. Vaccines.gov does not show every vaccine location in every state; it generally focuses on federally enrolled vaccine distributors such as pharmacies. In most cases, Vaccines.gov is easier to navigate than websites run by state governments.\n2. [Your state department of health website](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) will provide more comprehensive information about where and how you can get vaccinated in your state. These websites often highlight state-run vaccination sites, such as converted stadiums or convention centers. They also will likely provide more information on how to get vaccinated at locally-run sites, such as hospitals.\n3. Your local pharmacy and doctor, pharmacist, or community health center may allow walk-ins or have appointments for vaccines."

          "questionId": "are-covid-vaccines-safe",
          "answer": "Yes. While approved COVID vaccines were developed in record time, this does not mean that any safety protocols were bypassed. All vaccines have gone through rigorous testing to ensure their safety. Each vaccine underwent clinical trials where study participants were followed for two months after completing a vaccination series to ensure that the vaccine was safe and effective, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked). After clinical trials, the Food and Drug Administration reviewed the data and approved the vaccine for public use. Additionally, the Advisory Committee on Immunization carefully reviews all available data before making a recommendation to the CDC.\n\nEven after a vaccine is in use, the CDC continues to [monitor its safety](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html). For instance, the CDC and FDA thoroughly examined the very rare instance of blood clots in people who received the J&J vaccine. Ultimately, the FDA and CDC determined that the benefits of the J&J vaccine far outweigh its risks and recommended the continued use of this vaccine with monitoring. Informed by this continued monitoring, the CDC more recently [declared a preference for Pfizer and Moderna](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/janssen.html#When-to-Consider-J&J) vaccines over the J&J vaccine, and encourage individuals to discuss concerns with their doctor.\n\nAs vaccines are distributed, health care providers will continue to monitor and report adverse reactions to all vaccines through a [national warning system](https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html). Fortunately, of the millions of people vaccinated so far in the U.S., the vast majority have had only mild side effects if any at all."

While side effects may get in the way of your daily activities, they typically go away in a few days. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html), side effects may include: \n\n* **Pain and swelling on your arm** **where you received the shot**. This can be alleviated by applying a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area, or by using or exercising your arm. \n* **Fever, chills, tiredness, and headache**. To reduce discomfort from fever, drink plenty of fluids and dress lightly. You may also want to talk to your doctor about taking an over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. \n\nYou may want to contact your doctor or healthcare provider if: \n\n* The area around your shot becomes more red and tender after 24 hours.\n* Your side effects last longer than a few days or you feel concerned."

          "answer": "Keeping your COVID vaccine card safe is important. The card is not a legal document but rather a personal record of your medical care. It will most likely be safest if you keep it with your passport or other important papers. As with other personal documents, you should protect your privacy and avoid identity theft by not posting copies or photos (such as a selfie) of your card online in a manner that permits it to be read by others.\n\n* If you’re getting a two-shot vaccine, your vaccine card will note when you are due to get your second shot. It is  important to have it when you show up for your second appointment or booster shot.\n* You should take a picture of it, make hard copies, or produce a PDF or similar file by scanning it for your own records. Laminating the original card is not recommended, since it would make it difficult to add additional information to the card, such as your booster confirmation.\n* If you've lost your card, without having a backup, you can be re-issued a new card at the place where you got your first shot. You should not let a lost vaccine card deter you from getting your necessary shots."

          "answer": "According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html), pregnant people can receive a COVID vaccine. [A recent study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983) of over 35,000 pregnant individuals who received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines found that the shots were not associated with increased risk of pregnancy-related or neonatal adverse events. \n\nA number of women became [pregnant during vaccine clinical trials](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_wHIYX-tGkGBPwuax7N8BxZPR4PTTCDm/view) and went on to have healthy pregnancies, another good indicator of the safety of the vaccines for this population. In general, inactivated or killed virus vaccines are considered safe to use in pregnancy. For instance, every year pregnant people are able to get a new flu vaccine which is a vaccine that uses a killed version of the flu virus to help the body build natural immunity. This may provide guidance in how to think about COVID vaccine boosters should they become necessary. \n\nThere's also [evidence that antibodies present in breast milk can be transferred](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)00187-3/fulltext) to infants for added protection for the baby. However, as with other vaccines, the CDC recommends that pregnant and breastfeeding women consult their doctor with any questions about their health history and risk factors.",

          "answer": "While recent vaccination doesn’t eliminate all risk of COVID infection, there are activities that you can more safely resume if you’ve been vaccinated and/or boosted within the last 5 months.The protection from two doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine and a single dose of J&J  begins to wane over time and can decrease with the emergence of new, more transmissible  variants. It is recommended to get boosted at least 5 months after completing your primary vaccination series of Pfizer and Moderna, and 2 months after your J&J dose.  The activities that you can safely resume post-vaccination include visiting friends and family and not wearing a mask or practicing social distancing unless it is required by law or specific regulation. Local businesses and workplaces may continue to require masks and social distancing at their discretion.\n\nIf you are in a location with a high number of new COVID cases, wearing a mask in public will help you stay safe. If you are exposed to COVID, it's important to increase precautions, such as mask wearing around others, for 10 days. Regardless of symptoms, it's recommended to get tested 5 days after exposure to confirm whether you should continue to wear a mask and social distance for the remaining 5 days (if negative) or isolate (if positive).  \n\nThere is currently limited data on how protective vaccines are for immunocompromised people, so the [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) that anyone who is immunocompromised should consult their health care provider about these guidelines."

The federal government has purchased millions of vaccine shots and distributed them to providers. While providers may charge a fee for administering the vaccine, both private insurance and public programs must cover 100 percent of the fee, according to the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/vaccine-coverage-pricing-and-reimbursement-in-the-u-s/).

          "questionId": "vaccination-COVID-cause-positive-COVID",
          "answer": "Receiving a COVID vaccine will not cause you to test positive for COVID. The mRNA vaccines, like Pfizer and Moderna, give instructions for your cells to make a piece of the spike protein, not the entire viral genome. The vaccines simply do not have enough RNA or even the complete RNA sequence to give a positive signal in testing. Similarly, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — which takes a piece of DNA from the COVID spike protein and combines it with an [adenovirus to carry instructions](https://www.covidactnow.org/covid-explained/roundup-current-vaccine-progress) to your immune system — cannot cause you to test positive for COVID.\n\nIf you receive a positive test result in the days or weeks after you have been vaccinated, it is likely because it takes time for the vaccines to work and protection is not 100 percent effective. Anyone who becomes infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus should isolate as recommended.\n\nAfter vaccination, people may attempt to get a [serology, or antibody, test](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#serology-test) to see if the vaccine has “worked.” However, serology tests focus on a wide set of antibodies, and the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies only against the spike protein. So, in order to determine if vaccination has stimulated antibody production, we would need a test that specifically looks for antibodies to the spike protein."

If you’ve tested positive with an at-home rapid test, you can use a lab based test to confirm the results. After confirming your infection and informing those around you who may have been exposed, you should isolate yourself from others. \n\nThere are currently conflicting recommendations on the required length of isolation, but isolating for 10 days after a positive test result is the surest way to avoid infecting others. A secondary round of testing on day 5 of the isolation period can help you confirm whether you still need to isolate the remaining 5 days of the 10 day period. Once you hit day 10, it should definitely be safe for you to end your isolation."

For example, minorities tend to have [higher rates of poverty](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D), according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, and [less access to health care](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html). This puts them at greater risk of underlying medical conditions that result in more severe COVID cases. [The CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html) reports that racial and ethnic minorities are also more likely to be essential workers, live in multi-generational housing, and have less ability to take time off from work when sick or to work from home. Discrimination, including racism, contributes to long-term social deficits and more immediately to inadequate health care access, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html).

You can ensure that you are no longer contagious with COVID after 10 days by receiving a negative test result.  The [CDC has updated their recommended isolation period](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html) to five days, based on studies that have shown that the majority of transmissions take place early in the illness. However, if possible, you should isolate for the full 10 day period or until you receive a negative test result.

There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death.” (The CDC’s  offers further [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/coding-and-reporting.htm) on reporting and coding deaths due to COVID.)\n\nTracking the number of COVID deaths is difficult, and some suggest that the number is underreported. One issue is that individuals infected with the [virus](/glossary#virus) may be sick for many days, or even weeks, before death, so the increase in deaths resulting from a [wave](/glossary#wave) of [infections](/glossary#infection) may lag significantly in time. In some cases people may die indirectly from COVID, because hospitals were overcrowded with COVID patients and care was late or unavailable. To track the number of COVID deaths, researchers rely on something called “excess mortality” — the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis that are above the historical average during non-crisis times.

This new CDC framework and its recommendations account for all of this, and prioritize reducing severe illness and death and preventing healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. Its aim is to help communities across the country live safely with the coronavirus, while also, as much as possible, returning to some version of normal life.\n\nWe are not afraid to diverge from the CDC and other frameworks, and have done so repeatedly in the past.

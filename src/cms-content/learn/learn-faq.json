          "questionId": "how-get-vaccine-for-yourself-or-someone",
          "answer": "Nearly all COVID vaccine distributors require you to schedule an appointment in advance of getting a vaccine. When you or someone you care about becomes eligible, you can schedule an appointment online or over the phone. There are two primary ways you can find a vaccine appointment:\n\n1. [VaccineFinder](https://vaccinefinder.org/search/) is a federally supported website managed in partnership with the CDC. It allows individuals to see where vaccines are in stock near their selected zip code, and it provides the phone number, website link, and directions to these sites. VaccineFinder does not show every vaccine location in every state; it generally focuses on federally enrolled vaccine distributors such as pharmacies. In most cases, VaccineFinder is easier to navigate than websites run by state governments.\n\n2. [Your state department of health website](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) will provide more comprehensive information about where and how you can get vaccinated in your state. These websites often highlight state-run vaccination sites, such as converted stadiums or convention centers. They also will likely provide more information on how to get vaccinated at locally-run sites, such as hospitals.\n\nIt is important to note that while vaccines remain in high demand, securing a vaccine appointment may require persistence and effort. New vaccine appointments are added daily, so you should frequently check back online or call vaccination sites to see if appointments have become available."

          "question": "When can children get the COVID vaccine?",
          "questionId": "when-can-children-get-covid-vaccine",
          "answer": "No COVID vaccine is currently approved for use on children ages 15 and younger. [Pfizer recently announced](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal) positive results from its vaccine trial in children aged 12 to 15, which showed 100 percent efficacy against severe illness and death. It has applied to the FDA for emergency use authorization in the hopes that the age group will be able to get vaccinated prior to the fall school year. Moderna is also testing its vaccine in children, and should provide results soon.\n\nIn March 2021, Pfizer began a [trial for children 6 months to 11 years](https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine/additional-population-studies#gl-base:~:text=When%20can%20we%20expect%20results%20from%20this%20study%3F%20When%20will%20children%20be%20able%20to%20receive%20the%20vaccine%3F). We should expect results in the second half of 2021; if positive, it is likely children under 12 will be able to get vaccinated by early 2022 [according to Dr. Fauci](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/us-could-start-vaccinating-young-kids-in-early-2022-dr-fauci-says-.html#:~:text=Anthony%20Fauci%20said.,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202022.). \n\nChildren are difficult to study in vaccine trials because their immune system continues to develop from infancy through teenage years and is different at different ages. This means it is difficult to lump all ages of children into one trial group."

          "questionId": "are-covid-vaccines-safe",
          "answer": "Approved COVID vaccines were developed in record time, but this does not mean that any safety protocols were bypassed. All vaccines have gone through rigorous testing to ensure their safety. Each vaccine must undergo clinical trials, with study participants followed for two months after completing a vaccination series to prove that the vaccine is safe and effective, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked). After the Food and Drug Administration determines that a vaccine is safe, the Advisory Committee on Immunization carefully reviews all available data before making its recommendation to the CDC.\n\nEven after a vaccine is in use, the CDC continues to monitor its safety. Health care providers, for instance, are required to report adverse vaccine reactions to a [national warning system](https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html). Fortunately, of the first 1.9 million people to receive shots of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID vaccine, only 0.2% [experienced an adverse event](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm), such as fatique or headache, and very few reactions were serious.\n\nLearn more about [how federal partners are ensuring the safety of COVID vaccines in the United States.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html)"

While side effects may get in the way of your daily activities, they typically go away in a few days. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html), side effects may include: \n\n* **Pain and swelling on your arm** **where you received the shot**. This can be alleviated by applying a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area, or by using or exercising your arm. \n* **Fever, chills, tiredness, and headache**. To reduce discomfort from fever, drink plenty of fluids and dress lightly. You may also want to talk to your doctor about taking an over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. \n\nYou may want to contact your doctor or healthcare provider if: \n\n* The area around your shot becomes more red and tender after 24 hours.\n* Your side effects last longer than a few days or you feel concerned."

          "answer": "Keeping your COVID vaccine card safe is important. The card is not a legal document but rather a personal record of your medical care. It will most likely be safest if you keep it with your passport or other important papers. As with other personal documents, you should protect your privacy and avoid identity theft by not posting copies or photos (such as a selfie) of your card online in a manner that permits it to be read by others.\n\n* If you’re getting a two-shot vaccine, your vaccine card will note when you are due to get your second shot. It can also be important to have when you show up for your second appointment, especially at a walk-up clinic.\n* You should take a picture of it, make hard copies, or produce a PDF or similar file by scanning it for your own records. Laminating the original card is not recommended, since it would make it difficult to add additional information to the card, such as your second dose confirmation."

          "question": "Is it safe to get a COVID vaccine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding? ",
          "answer": "[Experts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html) believe COVID vaccines are unlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are pregnant, but current data is limited, as pregnant and breastfeeding people were not purposefully included in COVID vaccine trials. Because of this, the CDC recommends pregnant and breastfeeding individuals seek the advice of their doctor in order to make an informed decision about vaccination.\n\nOne good indicator of the safety of the vaccines is that a number of women became [pregnant during clinical trials](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_wHIYX-tGkGBPwuax7N8BxZPR4PTTCDm/view) and went on to have normal pregnancies. There is also a lot of data on other vaccinations during pregnancy. In general, inactivated, or killed virus, vaccines are considered safe to use in pregnancy. For instance, every year, pregnant people get a new flu vaccine, which is a killed virus vaccine. This may provide guidance in how to think about COVID vaccine boosters should they become necessary. \n\nThere's also [evidence that antibodies present in breast milk can be transferred](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)00187-3/fulltext) for added protection to the baby.",

While getting COVID may provide you with some natural immunity, it’s not clear how long this protection may last, says the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859#:~:text=Getting%20COVID%2D19%20might,COVID%2D19%20vaccine.). Some [studies](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30764-7/fulltext) have found that reinfection is possible, but a vaccine could boost your immune response.\n\n If you recently had COVID or were treated for COVID with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, the CDC recommends that you wait 90 days before getting a vaccine.",

          "answer": "According to the March 2021 [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html), if you are fully vaccinated, you can gather indoors with other fully vaccinated people without a mask. You can also gather with one other household of low risk, unvaccinated people. This means that if you’ve received the vaccine, you could socialize with another fully vaccinated family, but should not gather in larger groups or with high risk individuals.  \n\nHowever, it’s important to continue wearing a mask and practicing social distancing when you are in public. While there’s a growing amount of [evidence](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab229/6167855) that vaccines help reduce transmission, you should continue to take precautions, like wearing a mask and practicing social distancing, to protect those around you until enough people have received the vaccine. For now, the CDC also advises against travel. This means that grandparents could visit their low risk grandchildren if they live locally, but shouldn’t travel or meet with more than one other household at a time."

The federal government has purchased millions of vaccine shots and distributed them to providers. While providers may charge a fee for administering the vaccine, both private insurance and public programs must cover 100 percent of the fee, according to the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/vaccine-coverage-pricing-and-reimbursement-in-the-u-s/).

          "questionId": "vaccination-COVID-cause-positive-COVID",
          "answer": "Receiving a COVID vaccine will not cause you to test positive for COVID. The mRNA vaccines, like Pfizer and Moderna, give instructions for your cells to make a piece of the spike protein, not the entire viral genome. The vaccines simply do not have enough RNA or even the complete RNA sequence to give a positive signal in testing. Similarly, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — which takes a piece of DNA from the COVID spike protein and combines it with an [adenovirus to carry instructions](https://www.covidactnow.org/covid-explained/roundup-current-vaccine-progress) to your immune system — cannot cause you to test positive for COVID.\n\nIf you receive a positive test result in the days or weeks after you have been vaccinated, it is likely because it takes time for the vaccines to work and protection is not 100 percent effective. Anyone who becomes infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus should isolate as recommended.\n\nAfter vaccination, people may attempt to get a [serology, or antibody, test](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#serology-test) to see if the vaccine has “worked.” However, serology tests focus on a wide set of antibodies, and the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies only against the spike protein. So, in order to determine if vaccination has stimulated antibody production, we would need a test that specifically looks for antibodies to the spike protein."

The CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on April 14 to address this issue. We will continue to update this information as more data becomes available.]\n\nThe J & J vaccine is equally effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID as the other two FDA approved vaccines in the U.S., and nearly as effective against severe COVID cases. It’s easier to transport and store than the other vaccines, and it only requires one shot. \n\nCheck out efficacy details in the table below. While the J & J vaccine efficacy against mild, symptomatic disease is lower than it is for the other two approved vaccines, it was tested after the rise of the B. 1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, which are more transmissible. [Studies](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/pfizer-jab-may-not-be-as-potent-against-b-1-351-variant) suggest that if the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) were tested against these same variants, they may also have some decreased efficacy.\n\n![All three vaccines are 100% effective against COVID hospitalization and death.](/images_cms/screenshot-2021-03-29-211221.jpg \"Vaccine efficacy\")\n\nIn the future, boosters against the variants or for waning immunity might also become available, making the differences in these trials less important in the long run.\n\nTake away: The best vaccine is the one you can get soonest."

However, the risk of infection, and particularly of severe illness or death, is dramatically lower after vaccination. Cases of COVID that appear in fully vaccinated people, sometimes called “vaccine breakthrough cases” are expected, according to the CDC, as no vaccine currently on the market is 100 percent effective in preventing all infections.\n\nAs of April 13, 2021, more than 75 million people in the United States were fully vaccinated. During that time, there were 5,814 reported cases of COVID vaccine breakthrough. The CDC recognizes that this is most likely an undercount, since information is incomplete, but the overall picture is encouraging: “Vaccine breakthrough cases occur in only a small percentage of vaccinated persons.”"

For example, many minorities have higher rates of poverty and less access to health care. This puts them at greater risk of underlying medical conditions that result in more severe COVID cases. Racial and ethnic minorities are also more likely to be essential workers, live in crowded multi-generational housing, and have less financial resources to take off work when sick or provide for necessities while sheltering in place.

If you never develop symptoms, you can still be contagious for 10 days after your first positive test. However, [experts](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus#:~:text=Most%20people%20with%20coronavirus%20who,there%20are%20documented%20exceptions.) recommend quarantining for a full 14 days in case symptoms develop.

In Italy, which was one of the first countries to be hit hard by the disease, many survivors are still experiencing health problems after having COVID. In one [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351), more than 87 percent of individuals experienced one or more symptoms (most commonly fatigue and difficulty breathing) after recovery from COVID. Meanwhile, a German [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916) found that 78 of 100 recovered COVID patients continued to experience heart abnormalities months after [infection](/glossary#infection).",

          "answer": "The [WHO](https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf?ua=1) states that a COVID death can be “a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death.” (The CDC’s  offers further [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/coding-and-reporting.htm) on reporting and coding deaths due to COVID.)\n\nTracking the number of COVID deaths is difficult, and some suggest that the number is underreported. One issue is that individuals infected with the [virus](/glossary#virus) may be sick for many days, or even weeks, before death, so the increase in deaths resulting from a [wave](/glossary#wave) of [infections](/glossary#infection) may lag significantly in time. In some cases people may die indirectly from COVID, because hospitals were overcrowded with COVID patients and care was late or unavailable. To track the number of COVID deaths, researchers rely on something called “excess mortality” — the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis that are above the historical average during non-crisis times. For information on excess mortality, see the CDC’s report, [Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm).",

We as a community can change it by modifying community behavior (whether there are large gatherings) and intervention practices (whether people wear masks and maintain social distancing).\n\n![infection rate diagram shows how many people one person would go on to infect if RT is 3.](/images_cms/infection-rate-diagram.png \"COVID spread if infection rate is 3\")"

[R(t)](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#rt), in contrast, takes into account public health measures or the development of a [vaccine](https://covidactnow.org/glossary#vaccine). This makes R(t) —the actual or “effective” of the virus under current conditions — a more accurate reflection of the number of people that a single infected person is expected to infect in a specific area at a specific time. It is also more relevant than R₀ in directing public policy and informing private behavior. The value of R(t) can change over time, depending on such factors as how many people are staying home or wearing masks. At Covid Act Now, we look at R(t), or [infection rate](https://covidactnow.org/covid-risk-levels-metrics#infection-rate), because it represents more closely what is happening right now and is calculated based on actual case data.",

If a state or county has a *high* positive test rate, it is a sign of insufficient testing in that area. If a state or county has a *low* positive test rate, it is a sign that we are testing more than only the sickest people. Testing a larger number of at-risk populations (essential workers, people notified via contact tracing , etc.) is key to catching unknown infections before they can lead to an outbreak.\n\nLet’s look at the pictures below. **There are two positive COVID tests in each of these scenarios, but the positive test rate differs drastically due to the percentage of the population that is being tested.** The closer we get to testing everyone, the less likely we are to miss positive cases.\n\n![key for images](/images_cms/test-positivity-calculate-key.jpg \"key for images\")\n\n![scenario of insufficient testing with positive test rate of 20 percent, where only 10 percent of the population is tested. ](/images_cms/test-positivity-calculate-high.jpg \"Insufficient testing scenario\")\n\nIn the first scenario, two out of 10 people test positive for COVID, so the positive test rate is 20 percent.

Disposable and silk masks are also effective at repelling droplets. More people are wearing two layers of face masks, which some experts say makes common sense. Most important, however, is making sure your mask fits snugly over the bridge of your nose and below your chin. Studies have shown that loose-fitting masks, such as bandanas and gaiters, are the least effective. While N95 masks are the most effective at filtering out particles, they are still considered critical supplies and should be reserved for health care workers and first responders."

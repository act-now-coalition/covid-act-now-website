# Banner

Banners are usually added for one-off, specific features or occassions. Create a
banner using the base `Banner` component. Remember to:

- There must be only one banner in a page at any given time.
- Style banners differently when adding a new banner so users can distinguish them from previous banners.
- Add tracking for buttons and links.

## Examples

### Donation

<Story name="Donation">
  <DonationBanner />
</Story>

### Indigenous People's Day

<Story name="Feature">
  <FeatureBanner />
</Story>

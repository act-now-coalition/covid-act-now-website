          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            Epidemiology models use a metric called “R,” which effectively
            quantifies the disease’s “virality”: On average, how many other
            people someone with the disease will infect. COVID R values are
            educated guesses derived from disease data around the country and
            the world.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            The R value is then incorporated into an epidemiology model as a
            single, all-encompassing R value that is universally applied to the
            model’s projections for different regions. (This is the methodology
            our model started with, and is the methodology most common in COVID
            projection models.)
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            Our model is a bit different. It <em>infers</em> the R value from
            each state’s or county’s own COVID data and uses that custom,
            localized R value to make state- or county-specific projections (
            <a

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            In other words, we look at the COVID data for Alaska or San Mateo
            County and infer the actual rate at which COVID is spreading in
            Alaska and San Mateo County, respectively. This results in a R value
            specific to Alaska (and inferred from the Alaska data) and an R
            value specific to San Mateo County (and inferred from the San Mateo
            County data).
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            As a shorthand, we call these regionally-inferred, region-specific R
            values “R(t),” because they are the actual R value for a given
            place, be it Alaska or San Mateo County or anywhere else, at any
            given time.

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            A helpful framework for thinking about R(t) values: In order to
            eliminate COVID, the R(t) must be driven below 1.0. This means that,
            on average, each person with COVID will transmit to 0.9 other
            people, which means the disease is shrinking. An R(t) of 1.0 means
            COVID is in perfect equilibrium, neither growing nor shrinking. An
            R(t) greater than 1.0 means that COVID is growing exponentially. The
            greater the value above 1.0, the faster the doubling speed.

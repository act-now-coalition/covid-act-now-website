          What is Covid Act Now?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          Covid Act Now was started by four volunteers who saw the explosive and
          deadly growth of COVID infections around the world and felt they had
          to do something. The Covid Act Now team has partnered with some of
          America’s preeminent epidemiologists and data scientists to develop
          the U.S. Interventions Model.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          The U.S. Interventions Model is a data platform that projects COVID
          infections, hospitalizations, and deaths across the United States, as
          well as model how public health interventions contain the spread of
          COVID. We help decision makers understand when and how COVID will
          affect their communities in order to make better decisions that save
          lives.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          Our U.S. Interventions Model is being used at every level of
          government across the U.S., the military, private sector, and more.
          The model has also been adapted for use by several countries around
          the world, including India.

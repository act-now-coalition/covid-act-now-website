          <a href="CovidActNow.org" target="_blank">CovidActNow.org</a> was created by a team of data scientists, engineers, and designers in partnership with epidemiologists, public health officials, and political leaders to help understand how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect their region.

          We built this tool to answer critically important questions such as:

        <ul>
          <li>
            What will the impact be in my region be and when can I expect it?

          <li>
            How long until my hospital system is under severe pressure?
          </li>
          <li>
            What is my menu of interventions, and how will they address the spread of Coronavirus?

        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          Covid Act Now was started by four volunteers who saw the explosive and
          deadly growth of COVID infections around the world and felt they had
          to do something. The Covid Act Now team has partnered with some of
          America’s preeminent epidemiologists and data scientists to develop
          the U.S. Intervention Model.

              There is no historical precedent for what is going on right now to
              draw from.
            </li>
            <li>
              The default R0 used in this model is an average. The model does
              not adjust for the population density, culturally-determined
              interaction frequency and closeness, humidity, etc. in calculating
              R0.

            <li>
              This is not a node-based analysis and thus assumes everyone
              spreads the disease at the same rate. In practice, there are some
              folks who are “super-spreaders,” and others who are almost
              isolated. Interventions should be targeted primarily at those most
              likely to spread the disease.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only hospital beds in aggregate are considered. ICU beds and
              ventilators, which are likely to run low before beds, are not
              considered.
            </li>
            <li>
              Demographics, populations, and hospital bed count data are
              outdated. Demographics for the U.S. as a whole are used, rather
              than specific to each state.

            <li>
              In containment cases, we do not consider the longer-term impacts
              of maintaining containment; primarily, the reintroduction of COVID
              through travel. 14-day mandatory border quarantines, such as those
              currently in place in China, would likely need to be implemented

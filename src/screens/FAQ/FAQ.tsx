          About the U.S. Interventions Model
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h5" component="h5">
          What is the U.S. Interventions Model?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          The U.S. Interventions Model is a data platform that projects COVID
          infections, hospitalizations, and deaths across the United States, as
          well as models how public health interventions contain the spread of
          COVID and save lives. The U.S. Interventions Model is an SEIR model (a
          type of epidemiological model).
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h5" component="h5">
          Wait, what‚Äôs an SEIR model?
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          SEIR is a way of modeling infection diseases. Simply put, it
          specifically models the flows of people between four states:
          susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and resistant (R):
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          Susceptible (S) ‚Üí ùõÉ ‚Üí Exposed (E) ‚Üí ùù® ‚Üí Infectious (I) ‚Üí ùö™ ‚Üí Recovered
          (R)
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
          Each of those variables represents the number of people in those
          groups. The parameters beta (ùõÉ), sigma (ùù®), and gamma (ùö™) control how
          fast people move from one state to another. Our model is significantly
          more complicated than this, and even this might sound complicated, but
          in a nutshell this is the modeling approach we use. Why did we choose
          an SEIR approach? SEIR models are widely used by epidemiologists to
          model disease outbreaks in both research and practical settings. Our
          model is adapted from a model{' '}
          <a href="https://alhill.shinyapps.io/COVID19seir/">
            originally developed and built
          </a>{' '}
          by Dr. Alison Hill, a research fellow at Harvard‚Äôs Program for
          Evolutionary Dynamics.

          A non-exhaustive list:
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Only a small fraction of the world has been infected. It‚Äôs a new
              disease. Variables will change.
            </li>
            <li>
              R0s (
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number">
                R0 is a fundamental epidemiological metric
              </a>
              ) for interventions are guesses, in some cases informed by data.
              There is no historical precedent for what is going on right now to
              draw from.
            </li>
            <li>
              The default R0 used in this model is an average. The model does
              not adjust for the population density, culturally-determined
              interaction frequency and closeness, humidity, etc. in calculating
              R0.
            </li>
            <li>
              This is not a node-based analysis and thus assumes everyone
              spreads the disease at the same rate. In practice, there are some
              folks who are ‚Äúsuper-spreaders,‚Äù and others who are almost
              isolated. Interventions should be targeted primarily at those most
              likely to spread the disease.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only hospital beds in aggregate are considered. ICU beds and
              ventilators, which are likely to run low before beds, are not
              considered.
            </li>
            <li>
              Demographics, populations, and hospital bed count data are
              outdated. Demographics for the U.S. as a whole are used, rather
              than specific to each state.
            </li>

            <li>
              In containment cases, we do not consider the longer-term impacts
              of maintaining containment; primarily, the reintroduction of COVID
              through travel. 14-day mandatory border quarantines, such as those
              currently in place in China, would likely need to be implemented
              until a vaccine or therapeutic is developed.

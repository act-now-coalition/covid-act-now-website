- `parse-metro-areas.ts` Is a one-off script to generate a JSON file with data for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA)

## Note on Terminology

- **Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA)**: Have at least one urbanized area of 50,000+ population plus adjacent territory with strong social and economic ties to the urban center. There are 362 in total as of June 6, 2003.
- **Micropolitan Statistical Areas (µSA)**: Have between 10k - 50k population plus adjacent territory with strong social and economic ties to the urban center. There are 560 in total as of June 6, 2003.

A **Combined Statistical Area (CSA)** is a combination of adjacent MSA and µSA with economic ties, so it can be larger than a MSA. For example, the Seattle-Tacoma CSA is composed of the following metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas:

- Mount-Vernon-Anacortes (MSA)
- Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue (MSA)
- Olumpia-Lacey-Tumwater (MSA)
- Bremerton-Silverdale-Port Orchard (MSA)
- Shelton (µSA)
- Oak Harbor (µSA)
- Centralia (µSA)

# Covid Act Now
 
This is the code repository for https://covidactnow.org/ - a tool providing public leaders and health officials data to help answer the question: "how can the US reopen safely?"

## How to use this tool
This tool is built to enable political leaders to make decisions in their COVID-19 response informed by best available data and modeling.

### Here are the questions we built this tool to answer:
* What will the impact be in my region be and when can I expect it?
* How long until my hospital system is under severe pressure?
* What are my menu of interventions, and how will they address the spread of COVID-19?
